"A rubber ball (mass = 0.08 kg) is dropped from a height of 3.2 m, and after bouncing off the floor, rises almost to its original height. If the impact time with the floor is measured to be 0.04 s, what average force did the floor exert on the ball?
(A) 0.16 N
(B) 0.16 N
(C) 0.32 N
(D) 0.36 N",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the principles of physics related to momentum and force.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the velocity just before impact**:
   - The ball is dropped from a height \( h = 3.2 \) meters.
   - Using the equation for free fall: 
     \[
     v^2 = u^2 + 2as
     \]
     where \( u = 0 \) (initial velocity), \( a = g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), and \( s = h = 3.2 \, \text{m} \).
   - Therefore,
     \[
     v^2 = 0 + 2 \times 9.81 \times 3.2
     \]
     \[
     v^2 = 63.456
     \]
     \[
     v = \sqrt{63.456} \approx 7.97 \, \text{m/s}
     \]

2. **Determine the velocity just after impact**:
   - The ball rises almost to its original height, so it will have a similar speed but in the opposite direction.
   - Therefore, the velocity just after impact is also approximately \( 7.97 \, \text{m/s} \) (but directed upwards).

3. **Calculate the change in momentum**:
   - The initial momentum (\( p_i \)) of the ball before impact is:
     \[
     p_i = m \times v = 0.08 \, \text{kg} \times (-7.97) \, \text{m/s} = -0.6376 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}
     \]
   - The final momentum (\( p_f \)) of the ball after impact is:
     \[
     p_f = m \times v = 0.08 \, \text{kg} \times 7.97 \, \text{m/s} = 0.6376 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}
     \]
   - The change in momentum (\( \Delta p \)) is:
     \[
     \Delta p = p_f - p_i = 0.6376 + 0.6376 = 1.2752 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}
     \]

4. **Calculate the average force**:
   - The impulse-momentum theorem states that the change in momentum is equal to the impulse (force times time):
     \[
     F_{\text{avg}} \times t = \Delta p
     \]
   - Given \( t = 0.04 \, \text{s} \), we can solve for \( F_{\text{avg}} \):
     \[
     F_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta p}{t} = \frac{1.2752 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}}{0.04 \, \text{s}} = 31.88 \, \text{N}
     \]

"This question refers to the following information.
But the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.
—Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon
The reasons given in the above passage for the fall of the Roman Empire could also be applied to which other classical empires?
(A) Tang and Ottoman
(B) Ming and Aztec
(C) Han and Gupta
(D) Qin and Etruscan",C,"To answer this question, we need to carefully analyze the key points made in the passage about the fall of Rome. The main reasons given are:

1. **Immoderate greatness** leading to internal decay.
2. **Overextension** through conquests, which multiplied causes of destruction.
3. **Loss of military discipline and vigour**, due to corruption and the influence of mercenaries.
4. **Corruption in governance**, as emperors resorted to bribery to maintain control.
5. **Invasion by barbarians**.

Now let's evaluate each option:

(A) **Tang and Ottoman**: The Tang Dynasty is known for its cultural and economic prosperity, followed by internal strife and decline. The Ottoman Empire also experienced a period of expansion followed by internal decay and external pressures from other empires. This seems to fit the pattern described in the passage.

(B) **Ming and Aztec**: The Ming Dynasty saw significant growth but eventually faced challenges like corruption and internal rebellions, while the Aztec Empire was more focused on conquests before its fall due to Spanish invasion. While there are elements that could be compared, it doesn't fully match all aspects mentioned in the passage.

(C) **Han and Gupta**: Both empires experienced periods of great prosperity followed by decline due to internal issues like corruption and external pressures from invaders. This seems to align well with the description provided.

(D) **Qin and Etruscan**: The Qin Dynasty is known for its rapid rise and fall, but it didn't have a long period of internal decay or significant barbarian invasions as described in the passage. The Etruscan civilization also had a shorter timeline without the same level of complexity mentioned.

Considering these points, both options (A) Tang and Ottoman and (C) Han and Gupta seem to fit well with the reasons given for the fall of Rome. However, since the passage emphasizes the long-term decline due to internal factors more than external invasions, option (C) **Han and Gupta** might be a better match as it highlights both internal decay and external pressures.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is:

**(C) Han and Gupta**",0.0,"Analyze the question carefully, identify the key information provided, and select the answer that most accurately reflects this information based on logical reasoning.",3
"How many numbers are in the list $25, 26, 27, \ldots, 99, 100 ?$
(A) 75
(B) 76
(C) 22
(D) 23",B,"To determine how many numbers are in the list \(25, 26, 27, \ldots, 99, 100\), we can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. The general form of an arithmetic sequence is given by:

\[a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\]

where:
- \(a_n\) is the last term,
- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the number of terms.

In this problem, we have:
- The first term \(a_1 = 25\),
- The last term \(a_n = 100\),
- The common difference \(d = 1\) (since each subsequent number increases by 1).

We need to find the number of terms \(n\). Using the formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

\[100 = 25 + (n-1) \cdot 1\]

Simplify and solve for \(n\):

\[100 = 25 + n - 1\]
\[100 = 24 + n\]
\[n = 100 - 24\]
\[n = 76\]

Therefore, the number of terms in the list is \(\boxed{B}\).",1.0,"Analyze the question carefully, identify the key information provided, and select the answer that most accurately reflects this information based on logical reasoning.",3
"A cannon is mounted on a truck that moves forward at a speed of 5 m/s. The operator wants to launch a ball from a cannon so the ball goes as far as possible before hitting the level surface. The muzzle velocity of the cannon is 50 m/s. At what angle from the horizontal should the operator point the cannon?
(A) 5°
(B) 41°
(C) 45°
(D) 49°",D,"To determine the optimal launch angle for maximizing the range of a projectile, we need to consider both the initial velocity and the speed at which the truck is moving. The key here is that the cannon's muzzle velocity (50 m/s) should be combined with the truck's forward speed (5 m/s) in such a way as to maximize the horizontal distance traveled by the ball.

The range \( R \) of a projectile launched from an initial height \( h = 0 \) can be given by:
\[ R = v_0 \cos(\theta) t + v_{\text{truck}} t \]
where \( v_0 \) is the muzzle velocity, \( \theta \) is the launch angle, and \( t \) is the time of flight. The time of flight can be derived from the vertical motion equation:
\[ h = v_0 \sin(\theta) t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \]
Since \( h = 0 \), we get:
\[ 0 = v_0 \sin(\theta) t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \]
\[ t (v_0 \sin(\theta) - \frac{1}{2} g t) = 0 \]
This gives us \( t = 0 \) or:
\[ t = \frac{2 v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g} \]

Substituting this into the range equation, we get:
\[ R = v_0 \cos(\theta) \left( \frac{2 v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g} \right) + v_{\text{truck}} \left( \frac{2 v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g} \right) \]
\[ R = \frac{2 v_0^2 \cos(\theta) \sin(\theta)}{g} + \frac{2 v_{\text{truck}} v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g} \]
\[ R = \frac{v_0 \sin(2\theta)}{g} + \frac{2 v_{\text{truck}} v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g} \]

To maximize \( R \), we need to find the angle that maximizes this expression. The term \( \frac{v_0 \sin(2\theta)}{g} \) is maximized when \( 2\theta = 90^\circ \) or \( \theta = 45^\circ \). However, we also need to consider the additional horizontal velocity from the truck.

Given that the muzzle velocity is much larger than the truck's speed (50 m/s vs. 5 m/s), the angle should still be close to 45° but slightly adjusted due to the additional forward speed of the truck. The optimal angle will be slightly less than 45° because the horizontal component from the truck adds a small but significant boost.

Among the given options, (B) 41° is the closest to this value while still being practical for the scenario described.

Therefore, the answer is:
(B) 41°",0.0,"Analyze the question carefully, identify the key information provided, and select the answer that most accurately reflects this information based on logical reasoning.",3
"Factor $36-9x^2$.
(A) (6-3x)(6+3x)
(B) (-3x+6)(3x+6)
(C) 9(2-x)(2+x)
(D) 3(2+x)^2",C,"To factor the expression \(36 - 9x^2\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the form of the expression**: The given expression is a difference of squares, which has the general form \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\).

2. **Rewrite the expression in the form of a difference of squares**:
   \[
   36 - 9x^2 = (6)^2 - (3x)^2
   \]
   Here, \(a = 6\) and \(b = 3x\).

3. **Apply the difference of squares formula**: Using the formula \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\), we get:
   \[
   (6)^2 - (3x)^2 = (6 - 3x)(6 + 3x)
   \]

4. **Check the options**:
   - Option (A): \((6-3x)(6+3x)\) matches our factored form.
   - Option (B): \((-3x+6)(3x+6)\) is equivalent to \((6-3x)(6+3x)\), so it also matches.
   - Option (C): \(9(2-x)(2+x)\) does not match the original expression when expanded.
   - Option (D): \(3(2+x)^2\) does not match the original expression when expanded.
