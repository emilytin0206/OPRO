"A cannon is mounted on a truck that moves forward at a speed of 5 m/s. The operator wants to launch a ball from a cannon so the ball goes as far as possible before hitting the level surface. The muzzle velocity of the cannon is 50 m/s. At what angle from the horizontal should the operator point the cannon?
(A) 5°
(B) 41°
(C) 45°
(D) 49°",D,"To determine the optimal launch angle for maximizing the range of a projectile, we can use principles from physics. The key is to understand that the horizontal distance (range) covered by the cannonball depends on both its initial velocity and the launch angle.

Given:
- Speed of the truck = 5 m/s (horizontal component)
- Muzzle velocity of the cannon = 50 m/s

The total initial velocity \( v_0 \) can be broken down into horizontal (\( v_{x} \)) and vertical (\( v_{y} \)) components. The range \( R \) for a projectile launched with an angle \( \theta \) is given by the formula:
\[ R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g} + \frac{v_x t}{1} \]
where \( v_0 \) is the muzzle velocity, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s²), and \( t \) is the time of flight.

However, in this scenario, we need to consider that the truck itself moves forward at a constant speed, adding an additional horizontal component to the ball's motion. The effective initial velocity in the x-direction becomes:
\[ v_{x} = 50\cos(\theta) + 5 \]

The range \( R \) can be expressed as:
\[ R = (v_0 \cos(\theta) + 5)t \]
where \( t \) is the time of flight, which depends on the vertical motion and can be derived from the equation for the vertical component of velocity.

For maximum range, we need to maximize the expression involving both components. The optimal angle for a projectile launched without any initial horizontal speed (i.e., just considering the muzzle velocity) would typically be 45° because this maximizes \( \sin(2\theta) \). However, in this case, there is an additional constant horizontal component.

Given that the truck's speed is relatively small compared to the cannon's muzzle velocity (5 m/s vs. 50 m/s), the primary effect on the range will be from the initial velocity and angle. The angle of 45° would still provide a good approximation, but we need to consider the additional horizontal component.

By trial and error or using more detailed calculations, it can be shown that an angle slightly less than 45° (considering the truck's speed) will maximize the range. Given the options:

- (A) 5°: This is too small.
- (B) 41°: This is a reasonable candidate as it accounts for the additional horizontal component.
- (C) 45°: This would be ideal without any additional horizontal velocity, but with the truck's speed, it might not be optimal.
- (D) 49°: This angle is too large and may not maximize the range due to the added horizontal velocity.

Thus, the most precise answer that best aligns with both the context and requirements is:

"How many numbers are in the list $25, 26, 27, \ldots, 99, 100 ?$
(A) 75
(B) 76
(C) 22
(D) 23",B,"To determine how many numbers are in the list \(25, 26, 27, \ldots, 99, 100\), we can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. The general form of an arithmetic sequence is given by:

\[a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\]

where:
- \(a_n\) is the last term,
- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the number of terms.

In this problem, we have:
- The first term \(a_1 = 25\),
- The last term \(a_n = 100\),
- The common difference \(d = 1\) (since each subsequent number increases by 1).

We need to find \(n\), the number of terms. Using the formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

\[a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\]

Substitute the known values into the equation:

\[100 = 25 + (n-1) \cdot 1\]

Simplify and solve for \(n\):

\[100 = 25 + n - 1\]
\[100 = 24 + n\]
\[n = 100 - 24\]
\[n = 76\]

"This question refers to the following information.
But the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.
—Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon
The reasons given in the above passage for the fall of the Roman Empire could also be applied to which other classical empires?
(A) Tang and Ottoman
(B) Ming and Aztec
(C) Han and Gupta
(D) Qin and Etruscan",C,"To answer this question, we need to carefully analyze the reasons given in the passage for the fall of the Roman Empire. The key elements mentioned are:

1. **Immoderate greatness**: This suggests that as Rome grew larger and more powerful, it became harder to manage.
2. **Prosperity leading to decay**: As Rome prospered, internal problems such as corruption and social issues likely increased.
3. **Overextension of conquests**: The passage mentions that the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest, indicating that expansion beyond manageable limits contributed to decline.
4. **Loss of military discipline**: The text states that the legions' vices led to a loss of discipline, making them less effective and more prone to corruption.
5. **Corruption and reliance on mercenaries**: This suggests that relying on foreign troops or corrupting the army's loyalty was detrimental.

Now let’s evaluate each option:

(A) **Tang and Ottoman**:
- The Tang Dynasty in China experienced a period of great prosperity followed by internal strife, which aligns with the passage.
- The Ottoman Empire also expanded significantly and faced internal issues such as corruption and reliance on foreign mercenaries (Janissaries).

(B) **Ming and Aztec**:
- The Ming Dynasty saw significant expansion but did not face the same level of external threats or internal decay described in Rome’s case. 
- The Aztec Empire, while it had a rapid rise to power, did not have the complex administrative structures or extensive conquests that would lead to such a detailed analysis as provided for Rome.

(C) **Han and Gupta**:
- Both empires experienced periods of great prosperity followed by decline due to internal issues like corruption and overextension. This aligns well with the passage.
  
(D) **Qin and Etruscan**:
- The Qin Dynasty in China was known more for its unification efforts rather than a long period of expansion leading to decay.
- The Etruscan civilization, while influential, did not have the same level of detailed historical analysis as provided for Rome.

Considering these points, both options (A) and (C) seem plausible. However, since the passage provides more specific details about the decline due to internal factors like corruption and military discipline issues, which are particularly relevant to the Tang Dynasty's experience, it is most fitting.

"A rubber ball (mass = 0.08 kg) is dropped from a height of 3.2 m, and after bouncing off the floor, rises almost to its original height. If the impact time with the floor is measured to be 0.04 s, what average force did the floor exert on the ball?
(A) 0.16 N
(B) 0.16 N
(C) 0.32 N
(D) 0.36 N",C,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the average force exerted by the floor on the ball during its impact. We can use the principles of physics related to momentum and impulse.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the velocity just before hitting the floor:**

   The ball is dropped from a height \( h = 3.2 \, \text{m} \). Using the equation for free fall:
   \[
   v^2 = u^2 + 2gh
   \]
   where \( u = 0 \) (initial velocity), \( g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (acceleration due to gravity), and \( h = 3.2 \, \text{m} \).

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   v^2 = 0 + 2 \times 9.81 \times 3.2
   \]
   \[
   v^2 = 63.456
   \]
   \[
   v = \sqrt{63.456} \approx 7.97 \, \text{m/s}
   \]

2. **Determine the velocity just after bouncing:**

   Since the ball rises almost to its original height, we can assume it bounces back with a similar speed (neglecting air resistance and energy loss). Thus, the velocity just after impact is also approximately \( 7.97 \, \text{m/s} \) but in the opposite direction.

3. **Calculate the change in momentum:**

   The initial momentum (\( p_i \)) of the ball before hitting the floor:
   \[
   p_i = m \times v = 0.08 \, \text{kg} \times 7.97 \, \text{m/s} \approx 0.6376 \, \text{kg·m/s}
   \]

   The final momentum (\( p_f \)) of the ball after bouncing:
   \[
   p_f = m \times (-v) = -0.08 \, \text{kg} \times 7.97 \, \text{m/s} \approx -0.6376 \, \text{kg·m/s}
   \]

   The change in momentum (\( \Delta p \)):
   \[
   \Delta p = p_f - p_i = -0.6376 \, \text{kg·m/s} - 0.6376 \, \text{kg·m/s} = -1.2752 \, \text{kg·m/s}
   \]

4. **Calculate the average force using impulse:**

   Impulse (\( J \)) is given by:
   \[
   J = F_{\text{avg}} \times t
   \]
   where \( t = 0.04 \, \text{s} \) (impact time).

   Since impulse equals the change in momentum:
   \[
   J = \Delta p = -1.2752 \, \text{kg·m/s}
   \]

   Solving for the average force (\( F_{\text{avg}} \)):
   \[
   F_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta p}{t} = \frac{-1.2752 \, \text{kg·m/s}}{0.04 \, \text{s}} \approx -31.88 \, \text{N}
   \]

The negative sign indicates the direction of the force (opposite to the initial velocity), but for the magnitude, we consider:
\[
F_{\text{avg}} \approx 31.88 \, \text{N}
\]

However, this value does not match any of the provided options directly. Let's recheck with simpler approximations:

- The ball’s momentum change is \( 2 \times 0.6376 = 1.2752 \, \text{kg·m/s} \).
- Using \( t = 0.04 \, \text{s} \):
\[
F_{\text{avg}} = \frac{1.2752}{0.04} \approx 31.88 \, \text{N}
\]

Given the options:
(A) 0.16 N
(B) 0.16 N
(C) 0.32 N
(D) 0.36 N

The closest reasonable answer is (C) 0.32 N.

"Factor $36-9x^2$.
(A) (6-3x)(6+3x)
(B) (-3x+6)(3x+6)
(C) 9(2-x)(2+x)
(D) 3(2+x)^2",C,"To factor the expression \(36 - 9x^2\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the form of the expression**: The given expression is a difference of squares, which has the general form \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\).

2. **Rewrite the expression in the form of a difference of squares**:
   \[
   36 - 9x^2
   \]
   Notice that both terms can be written as squares:
   \[
   36 = 6^2 \quad \text{and} \quad 9x^2 = (3x)^2
   \]
   Therefore, the expression becomes:
   \[
   6^2 - (3x)^2
   \]

3. **Apply the difference of squares formula**:
   Using \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\), where \(a = 6\) and \(b = 3x\):
   \[
   6^2 - (3x)^2 = (6 - 3x)(6 + 3x)
   \]

4. **Check the options**:
   - Option (A): \((6-3x)(6+3x)\) matches our factored form.
   - Option (B): \((-3x+6)(3x+6)\) is equivalent to \((6-3x)(6+3x)\), just with the terms rearranged, so it also works.
   - Option (C): \(9(2-x)(2+x)\) does not match our factored form.
   - Option (D): \(3(2+x)^2\) is a perfect square trinomial and does not match our expression.

   Both options (A) and (B) are correct, but since we need to choose one, we can select either. However, typically in such questions, the simplest form or the first matching option is preferred.
