"How many numbers are in the list $25, 26, 27, \ldots, 99, 100 ?$
(A) 75
(B) 76
(C) 22
(D) 23",B,"To determine how many numbers are in the list \(25, 26, 27, \ldots, 99, 100\), we can use the formula for finding the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. The general form of an arithmetic sequence is given by:

\[a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\]

where:
- \(a_n\) is the last term,
- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference, and
- \(n\) is the number of terms.

In this problem:
- The first term (\(a_1\)) is 25.
- The last term (\(a_n\)) is 100.
- The common difference (\(d\)) is 1 (since each subsequent number increases by 1).

We need to find \(n\), the number of terms. Using the formula for the \(n\)-th term:

\[a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\]

Substitute the known values into the equation:

\[100 = 25 + (n-1) \cdot 1\]

Simplify and solve for \(n\):

\[100 = 25 + n - 1\]
\[100 = 24 + n\]
\[n = 100 - 24\]
\[n = 76\]

Therefore, the number of terms in the list is \(\boxed{B}\).",1.0,"Analyze the provided scenario in detail, pinpoint key facts, apply logical reasoning based on the given context, and select the most accurate answer that aligns with the presented information.",5
"A rubber ball (mass = 0.08 kg) is dropped from a height of 3.2 m, and after bouncing off the floor, rises almost to its original height. If the impact time with the floor is measured to be 0.04 s, what average force did the floor exert on the ball?
(A) 0.16 N
(B) 0.16 N
(C) 0.32 N
(D) 0.36 N",C,"To solve this problem, we need to apply principles of physics related to motion and forces.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the velocity just before impact:**
   - The ball is dropped from a height \( h = 3.2 \) meters.
   - Using the equation for free fall: 
     \[
     v^2 = u^2 + 2as
     \]
     where \( u = 0 \) (initial velocity), \( s = h = 3.2 \, \text{m} \), and \( a = g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).
   - Therefore,
     \[
     v^2 = 0 + 2 \times 9.81 \times 3.2
     \]
     \[
     v^2 = 63.456
     \]
     \[
     v = \sqrt{63.456} \approx 7.97 \, \text{m/s}
     \]

2. **Determine the velocity just after impact:**
   - The ball rises almost to its original height, so it will have a similar speed but in the opposite direction.
   - Therefore, the velocity just after impact is also approximately \( 7.97 \, \text{m/s} \) (but upwards).

3. **Calculate the change in momentum:**
   - The initial momentum (\( p_i \)) of the ball before impact:
     \[
     p_i = m \times v = 0.08 \, \text{kg} \times 7.97 \, \text{m/s} \approx 0.6376 \, \text{kg·m/s}
     \]
   - The final momentum (\( p_f \)) of the ball after impact:
     \[
     p_f = m \times (-v) = 0.08 \, \text{kg} \times (-7.97 \, \text{m/s}) \approx -0.6376 \, \text{kg·m/s}
     \]
   - The change in momentum (\( \Delta p \)):
     \[
     \Delta p = p_f - p_i = -0.6376 - 0.6376 = -1.2752 \, \text{kg·m/s}
     \]

4. **Calculate the average force using impulse-momentum theorem:**
   - The impulse-momentum theorem states that the change in momentum is equal to the impulse (force times time):
     \[
     F_{\text{avg}} \times t = \Delta p
     \]
   - Given \( t = 0.04 \, \text{s} \), we can solve for \( F_{\text{avg}} \):
     \[
     F_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta p}{t} = \frac{-1.2752 \, \text{kg·m/s}}{0.04 \, \text{s}} = -31.88 \, \text{N}
     \]
   - The negative sign indicates the direction of the force (upwards), but we are interested in the magnitude.

### Conclusion:
The average force exerted by the floor on the ball is approximately \( 31.88 \, \text{N} \). However, this value does not match any of the provided options exactly. Given the closest option:

- **(C) 0.32 N** seems to be a misprint or simplification in the problem statement.

The correct answer should be closer to \( 31.88 \, \text{N} \), but based on the given choices, there might be an error in the options provided. The closest logical choice from the given options is:

**(C) 0.32 N** (assuming a possible misprint or simplification).

However, for accurate calculations, the force should be around \( 31.88 \, \text{N} \).",1.0,"Analyze the provided scenario in detail, pinpoint key facts, apply logical reasoning based on the given context, and select the most accurate answer that aligns with the presented information.",5
"This question refers to the following information.
But the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.
—Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon
The reasons given in the above passage for the fall of the Roman Empire could also be applied to which other classical empires?
(A) Tang and Ottoman
(B) Ming and Aztec
(C) Han and Gupta
(D) Qin and Etruscan",C,"To answer this question, we need to carefully analyze the key points in the passage provided by Edward Gibbon regarding the fall of the Roman Empire. The main reasons cited for Rome's decline include:

1. **Immoderate greatness**: This suggests that as Rome expanded and became more powerful, it also faced internal challenges.
2. **Prosperity leading to decay**: Economic prosperity can lead to complacency and a weakening of institutions.
3. **Conquest and the multiplication of causes of destruction**: As Rome conquered more territories, it had to manage larger and more diverse populations, which could introduce new problems.
4. **Loss of military discipline and corruption**: The passage mentions that the legions became corrupt over time, leading to reduced effectiveness.
5. **Internal conflicts and reliance on mercenaries**: This suggests a weakening of traditional military strength due to external influences.

Now let's evaluate each option:

(A) **Tang and Ottoman**:
- Tang Dynasty: While it faced internal issues like corruption and regional rebellions, the passage does not specifically mention the Tang Empire.
- Ottoman Empire: The decline of the Ottoman Empire is often attributed to similar factors such as economic problems, military overextension, and internal corruption. This empire fits well with the described reasons.

(B) **Ming and Aztec**:
- Ming Dynasty: While it faced issues like corruption and economic stagnation, the passage does not specifically mention this dynasty.
- Aztec Empire: The Aztecs declined due to external factors such as Spanish conquest rather than internal decay. This empire does not fit well with the described reasons.

(C) **Han and Gupta**:
- Han Dynasty: Like Rome, it faced issues of overextension and corruption but is more often associated with a gradual decline.
- Gupta Empire: The Gupta Empire declined due to external invasions and internal strife rather than the same internal decay as described for Rome. This empire does not fit well with the described reasons.

(D) **Qin and Etruscan**:
- Qin Dynasty: It was relatively short-lived, and its fall is more attributed to internal political instability and external threats.
- Etruscan Empire: The Etruscans were conquered by the Romans themselves. Their decline does not fit well with the described reasons.

Given this analysis, the most accurate answer that aligns with the presented information about the fall of Rome due to internal decay is:

**(A) Tang and Ottoman**",0.0,"Analyze the provided scenario in detail, pinpoint key facts, apply logical reasoning based on the given context, and select the most accurate answer that aligns with the presented information.",5
"A cannon is mounted on a truck that moves forward at a speed of 5 m/s. The operator wants to launch a ball from a cannon so the ball goes as far as possible before hitting the level surface. The muzzle velocity of the cannon is 50 m/s. At what angle from the horizontal should the operator point the cannon?
(A) 5°
(B) 41°
(C) 45°
(D) 49°",D,"To determine the optimal launch angle for maximizing the range of a projectile, we need to consider both the initial velocity and the speed at which the truck is moving. The key here is that the cannon's muzzle velocity (50 m/s) should be combined with the truck's forward motion (5 m/s).

The total initial velocity \( v_0 \) can be broken down into two components:
1. Horizontal component: \( v_{0x} = 50 \cos(\theta) + 5 \)
2. Vertical component: \( v_{0y} = 50 \sin(\theta) \)

The range \( R \) of a projectile is given by the formula:

\[ R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g} \]

However, in this scenario, we need to account for the horizontal component being influenced by both the cannon's muzzle velocity and the truck's speed. The effective initial horizontal velocity \( v_{0x} \) is:

\[ v_{0x} = 50 \cos(\theta) + 5 \]

The range can be expressed as:

\[ R = v_{0x} t = (50 \cos(\theta) + 5) t \]

where \( t \) is the time of flight. The time of flight for a projectile launched vertically with an initial vertical velocity \( v_{0y} \) and under gravity \( g \) is:

\[ t = \frac{2v_{0y}}{g} = \frac{2 \cdot 50 \sin(\theta)}{9.81} \]

Substituting this into the range equation, we get:

\[ R = (50 \cos(\theta) + 5) \left( \frac{100 \sin(\theta)}{9.81} \right) \]
\[ R = \frac{5000 \cos(\theta) \sin(\theta) + 500 \sin(\theta)}{9.81} \]

To maximize \( R \), we need to find the angle \( \theta \) that maximizes this expression. The term \( \cos(\theta) \sin(\theta) \) can be simplified using the double-angle identity:

\[ \cos(\theta) \sin(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \sin(2\theta) \]

Thus, we have:

\[ R = \frac{5000 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \sin(2\theta) + 500 \sin(\theta)}{9.81} \]
\[ R = \frac{2500 \sin(2\theta) + 500 \sin(\theta)}{9.81} \]

To find the angle that maximizes this, we can test the given options:

- For \( \theta = 41^\circ \):
  - \( \cos(41^\circ) \approx 0.7547 \)
  - \( \sin(41^\circ) \approx 0.6561 \)
  - \( \sin(2\cdot41^\circ) = \sin(82^\circ) \approx 0.9903 \)

\[ R_{41} = \frac{2500 \cdot 0.9903 + 500 \cdot 0.6561}{9.81} \]
\[ R_{41} \approx \frac{2475.75 + 328.05}{9.81} \]
\[ R_{41} \approx \frac{2803.8}{9.81} \]
\[ R_{41} \approx 285.6 \, \text{meters} \]

- For \( \theta = 45^\circ \):
  - \( \cos(45^\circ) = \sin(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \approx 0.7071 \)
  - \( \sin(90^\circ) = 1 \)

\[ R_{45} = \frac{2500 \cdot 1 + 500 \cdot 0.7071}{9.81} \]
\[ R_{45} \approx \frac{2500 + 353.55}{9.81} \]
\[ R_{45} \approx \frac{2853.55}{9.81} \]
\[ R_{45} \approx 290.7 \, \text{meters} \]

(C) 9(2-x)(2+x)
(D) 3(2+x)^2",C,"To factor the expression \(36 - 9x^2\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the form of the expression**: The given expression is a difference of squares, which has the general form \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\).

2. **Rewrite the expression in the form of a difference of squares**:
   \[
   36 - 9x^2

   Notice that both terms can be written as squares:
   \[
   36 = 6^2 \quad \text{and} \quad 9x^2 = (3x)^2
   \]
   Therefore, the expression becomes:
   \[
   6^2 - (3x)^2

3. **Apply the difference of squares formula**:
   Using \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\), we get:
   \[
   6^2 - (3x)^2 = (6 - 3x)(6 + 3x)

5. **Verify the correctness**:
   - Option (A) matches our factored form.
   - Option (B) is just a rearrangement of terms, which is equivalent to option (A).
   - Option (C) does not match because it involves different factors and constants.
   - Option (D) does not match as it expands to \(3(4 + 4x + x^2)\), which is not the same.
