"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (work required),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\( C \)) = 10 µF = \( 10 \times 10^{-6} \, F \)
- Potential difference (\( V \)) = 100 V

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} \, F) \times (100 \, V)^2 \]

First, calculate \( V^2 \):

\[ V^2 = (100 \, V)^2 = 10000 \, V^2 \]

Now substitute back into the equation:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \, J \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \, J \]
\[ U = 0.005 \, J \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that the expression under the square root is positive and that the denominator is not zero. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Identify where the denominator is defined:**
   The denominator of the function is \( \sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 4} \). For the square root to be defined, the expression inside it must be greater than zero (since the square root of a non-positive number would either be undefined or imaginary in real numbers).

2. **Solve the inequality:**
   We need to solve \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).
   
   First, factorize the quadratic expression:
   \[
   x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1)
   \]
   So, we have:
   \[
   (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0
   \]

3. **Determine the intervals where the inequality holds:**
   The roots of the equation \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \) are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

   We test a point in each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied:
   
   - For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \): Choose \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
   - For \( x \in (-1, 4) \): Choose \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
   - For \( x \in (4, \infty) \): Choose \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

   Therefore, the inequality \( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \) holds for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

4. **Combine with the requirement that the denominator is not zero:**
   The expression under the square root must be strictly positive, so we exclude the points where it equals zero, which are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \). These points do not need to be excluded because they were already excluded by the inequality.

5. **Conclusion:**
   The domain of the function is:
   \[
   (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty)
   \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved:

1. **Induced Electric Field in Conductors**: When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, the electric field from the nonconducting sphere will induce charges on the surface of the conducting sphere.

2. **Charge Induction and Distribution**: In a conductor, free electrons can move freely under the influence of an external electric field. The presence of the positively charged nonconducting sphere will push some of these free electrons towards one side of the conducting sphere, leaving the other side with a net positive charge (induced by the external field).

3. **Charge Distribution on Conductors**: In equilibrium, the charges in a conductor distribute themselves such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. This means that any induced charges will be distributed on the surface of the conductor.

4. **Electrostatic Forces Between Spheres**: The nonconducting sphere with +Q and the conducting sphere with an induced charge distribution (one side positive, one side negative) will experience electrostatic forces due to their opposite charges.

Given these principles:

- Option (A): An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere. This is true because the external electric field from the nonconducting sphere will induce a charge redistribution on the surface of the conducting sphere.
  
- Option (B): The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q. This is not necessarily correct because only one side of the conducting sphere will have an induced negative charge, and it won't be exactly equal to -Q; rather, there will be a distribution of charges.

- Option (C): The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction. This is true due to the opposite charges that develop on the surfaces of the two spheres: positive on one side of the conducting sphere and negative on the other side, attracting the nonconducting sphere with +Q.

- Option (D): The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion. This is incorrect because the induced charges on the conducting sphere will create a net attractive force between the spheres due to their opposite charges.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",0.0,Analyze the problem thoroughly and select the correct answer from the options provided.,1
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"The correct answer is (C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.

Explanation:
- **Supreme Court Precedent:** The Supreme Court has established that declaratory judgments are available to individuals who have a ""genuine and immediate"" threat of prosecution under state laws. This is based on the principle that a person should not be forced to wait until they are prosecuted before seeking judicial review.
- **Genuine Threat of Enforcement:** In this case, the law student's companions were arrested for criminal trespass and loitering after continuing their protest despite warnings from the police. The prior warnings issued by the police also indicate an ongoing threat of enforcement against those engaging in similar activities.
- **Precedent Examples:** Cases like *Warth v. Seldin* (1975) and *Lesar v. Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Wis.* (1980) support the idea that a declaratory judgment can be sought when there is a genuine threat of enforcement, even if the plaintiff has not yet been prosecuted.

Therefore, based on these principles, the federal district court would likely deny a motion to dismiss and allow the law student's declaratory judgment action.",1.0,Analyze the problem thoroughly and select the correct answer from the options provided.,1
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the numbers without any remainder.

The given orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

To find the LCM, we can start by finding the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **LCM Calculation**:
   The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers.
   - For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Therefore, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 = 8 \times 27 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Thus, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.

The correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,Analyze the problem thoroughly and select the correct answer from the options provided.,1
