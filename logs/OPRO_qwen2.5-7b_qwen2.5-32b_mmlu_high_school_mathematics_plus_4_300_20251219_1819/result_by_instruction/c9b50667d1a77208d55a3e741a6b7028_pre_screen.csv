"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Setup**: We have two spheres - one nonconducting sphere with a net electric charge +Q and a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius.

2. **Electric Field Induction in Conductors**:
   - When a charged object is brought close to a conductor, an induced charge distribution occurs on the surface of the conductor. This happens because free electrons within the conductor can move under the influence of the external electric field.
   
3. **Induced Charges and Electric Fields**:
   - The nonconducting sphere with +Q will create an electric field around it. When this charged sphere is brought close to the neutral conducting sphere, the side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere will experience a higher electric field strength due to the presence of the charge +Q.
   - As a result, free electrons in the conducting sphere will be repelled towards the opposite (farther) side of the sphere. This leaves an excess of positive charges on the side closer to the nonconducting sphere and negative charges on the other side.

4. **Net Charge on Conducting Sphere**:
   - The net charge on the conducting sphere remains zero because the total number of electrons in the conductor is conserved, but their distribution changes due to induction.
   
5. **Electrostatic Forces Between Spheres**:
   - Since one sphere has a +Q charge and the other side of the conducting sphere will have an induced –Q charge (due to electron redistribution), there will be an attractive force between them because opposite charges attract.

Now, let's evaluate each option:

(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
- This is true. The electric field from the nonconducting sphere induces a charge distribution on the surface of the conducting sphere.

(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
- This is incorrect because the total charge in the conductor remains zero; only the distribution changes due to induction.

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
- This is true. The induced charges create an attractive force between the two spheres.

(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.
- This is incorrect. Since one sphere has a +Q charge and the other side of the conducting sphere has –Q, there will be an attractive force, not repulsion.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the principles of electrostatics, the correct answer is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement in detail, apply relevant theories or calculations as required, eliminate incorrect options based on logical reasoning, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",12
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To analyze this problem statement, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedent. The key points to examine include:

1. **Nature of Declaratory Judgment**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that determines the rights and obligations between parties without ordering any specific action or awarding damages.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent on Declaratory Judgments**: In cases like *Warth v. Seldin* (1975), the Supreme Court established criteria for when declaratory judgments can be granted, including a ""real and immediate"" threat of enforcement against the plaintiff.

3. **Equity and Comity**: Courts generally avoid issuing declarations that might interfere with ongoing state prosecutions or administrative proceedings to maintain comity between federal and state courts.

Now let's analyze each option:

(A) **Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**
- This option suggests a dismissal based on interference with state prosecutions. However, the law student is not currently facing prosecution; his companions are. The threat to him is speculative at this point.

(B) **No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.**
- This option is incorrect because it does not consider the ""real and immediate"" threat requirement established by *Warth v. Seldin*.

(C) **No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**
- This option seems plausible at first glance but needs to be scrutinized further. While there is evidence of past enforcement actions, it's not clear if these actions are directly applicable or if they create an immediate and real threat.

(D) **Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.**
- This option aligns with *Warth v. Seldin* criteria, which require that the plaintiff show a ""real and immediate"" threat of enforcement. The fact that the law student has not been arrested himself yet does make his fear speculative.

Given these considerations, the most accurate answer is:

**(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.**

This option correctly applies the legal standards for granting declaratory judgments and acknowledges that without an immediate threat to the plaintiff himself, the action may be premature.",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement in detail, apply relevant theories or calculations as required, eliminate incorrect options based on logical reasoning, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",12
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Next, multiply the values:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 50 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 0.05 \, \text{J} \]

"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

### Step 1: Factorize the quadratic expression
First, we factorize the quadratic equation:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

### Step 2: Determine where the factors are zero
Set each factor to zero to find the critical points:
\[ x - 4 = 0 \implies x = 4 \]
\[ x + 1 = 0 \implies x = -1 \]

These points divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 3: Test each interval
We need to determine where the product \((x-4)(x+1)\) is positive. We can test a point in each interval:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \), choose \( x = -2 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]

- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \), choose \( x = 0 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \), choose \( x = 5 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

### Step 4: Combine the results
The expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \) is positive in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 5: Exclude points where the denominator is zero
Since the function has a square root in the denominator, we must exclude the points where the expression under the square root is zero. These are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \). Therefore, these points cannot be included in the domain.

### Conclusion
The domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:
\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Identify the Highest Powers of Each Prime**:
   - For \(2\): The highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\): The highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\): The highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

3. **Calculate the LCM**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2
   \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     - \(2^3 = 8\)
     - \(3^3 = 27\)
     - \(5^2 = 25\)

4. **Multiply the Results**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 8 \times 27 \times 25
   \]
   - First, multiply 8 and 27:
     \[
     8 \times 27 = 216
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by 25:
     \[
     216 \times 25 = 5400
     \]

Thus, the least common multiple of 360, 450, and 540 is 5400.

### Conclusion:

The minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days. Therefore, the correct answer is:
