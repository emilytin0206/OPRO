"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 0.005 J.",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement in detail, apply relevant theories or calculations, eliminate incorrect options based on provided information, and select the most accurate answer from those given.",10
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To analyze this problem statement, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedent and the specific circumstances presented.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that clarifies or declares one's rights under existing laws without ordering any action. The primary purpose is to provide clarity on the legality of certain conduct before it results in actual harm.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent and Declaratory Judgments**: In *Warth v. Seldin* (1975), the Supreme Court established criteria for declaratory judgment actions, including:
   - A real and immediate controversy.
   - An actual or imminent threat of enforcement against the plaintiff.

3. **Applying the Criteria**:
   - **Real and Immediate Controversy**: The law student is seeking a declaration on the constitutionality of criminal trespass and loitering statutes. This involves a direct legal question that could affect his future actions.
   - **Actual or Imminent Threat of Enforcement**: The arrest of the companions and prior warnings indicate an actual threat of enforcement against those engaging in similar conduct, which can be reasonably extrapolated to include the law student.

4. **Evaluating the Options**:
   - **Option A**: This option suggests that declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions. While this is a valid concern, it does not directly address whether there is an actual or imminent threat of enforcement against the plaintiff.
   - **Option B**: This option states that a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute. However, given the specific circumstances and Supreme Court precedent, this is less likely to be correct because there is an actual or imminent threat of enforcement.
   - **Option C**: This option correctly identifies that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on the arrest of his companions and prior warnings. This aligns with *Warth v. Seldin* criteria for a real and immediate controversy.
   - **Option D**: This option suggests that declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears are speculative. However, given the concrete actions taken against his friends and the warnings received, this is not accurate.

Based on the analysis of Supreme Court precedent and the specific circumstances provided:

**The correct answer is (C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly identifies that there is an actual or imminent threat of enforcement against the plaintiff, which satisfies the criteria for a declaratory judgment action under *Warth v. Seldin*.",1.0,"Analyze the problem statement in detail, apply relevant theories or calculations, eliminate incorrect options based on provided information, and select the most accurate answer from those given.",10
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

### Step 1: Factorize the quadratic expression
First, we factorize the quadratic equation:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

### Step 2: Determine where the factors are zero
Set each factor to zero and solve for \( x \):
\[ x - 4 = 0 \implies x = 4 \]
\[ x + 1 = 0 \implies x = -1 \]

These points, \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \), divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 3: Test each interval
We need to determine where the product \((x-4)(x+1)\) is positive. We can test a point in each interval:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \), choose \( x = -2 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]

- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \), choose \( x = 0 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \), choose \( x = 5 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

### Step 4: Combine the intervals where the expression is positive
From the tests, we see that:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \text{ in } (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

### Step 5: Ensure the denominator is not zero
The points \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \) make the denominator zero. Therefore, these points must be excluded from the domain.

### Conclusion
Combining all the conditions, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:
\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Setup**: We have two spheres - one nonconducting sphere with a net electric charge +Q and a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius.

2. **Electric Field Induction in Conductors**:
   - When a charged object is brought close to a conductor, an induced charge distribution occurs on the surface of the conductor. This happens because free electrons within the conductor can move under the influence of the external electric field created by the nonconducting sphere.
   
3. **Charge Distribution on the Conducting Sphere**:
   - The conducting sphere will develop charges such that the net electric field inside it is zero (one of the fundamental properties of conductors). This means that positive charges will be induced on one side and negative charges on the other side, creating an internal electrostatic equilibrium.
   
4. **Induced Charges**:
   - Since the nonconducting sphere has a +Q charge, the conducting sphere will develop a net electric field due to this external charge. The electrons in the conductor will move towards the side of the sphere that is closer to the nonconducting sphere, leaving an equal and opposite charge on the other side.
   
5. **Net Charge on the Conducting Sphere**:
   - As a result, the conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q (since it has gained electrons).

6. **Electrostatic Forces Between Spheres**:
   - The nonconducting sphere with +Q and the induced –Q charge on the conducting sphere will experience an electrostatic attraction due to opposite charges.

Now let's evaluate each option:

- **(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere**: This is true, but it does not directly answer what happens between the spheres.
  
- **(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q**: This is correct based on our analysis.

- **(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction**: This is also correct and follows from Coulomb's law, but it is not the most specific answer to what happens with the charges themselves.
  
- **(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion**: This is incorrect because opposite charges attract.

Given these considerations, the most accurate answer based on the provided information is:

**(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**

This directly addresses what happens to the charge distribution on the conducting sphere due to induction by the nonconducting charged sphere.",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement in detail, apply relevant theories or calculations, eliminate incorrect options based on provided information, and select the most accurate answer from those given.",10
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers without any remainder.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Identify the Highest Powers of Each Prime**:
   - For \(2\): The highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\): The highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\): The highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

3. **Calculate the LCM**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2
   \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     - \(2^3 = 8\)
     - \(3^3 = 27\)
     - \(5^2 = 25\)

4. **Multiply the Results**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 8 \times 27 \times 25
   \]
   - First, multiply 8 and 27:
     \[
     8 \times 27 = 216
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by 25:
     \[
     216 \times 25 = 5400
     \]

Thus, the least common multiple of 360, 450, and 540 is 5400.

### Conclusion:

The minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days. Therefore, the correct answer is:
