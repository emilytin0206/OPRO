"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the given scenario.

1. **Induced Electric Field (Option A):**
   - When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere. This is because the presence of the charged nonconducting sphere will cause charges in the conducting sphere to rearrange themselves due to electrostatic induction.

2. **Net Electric Charge on the Conducting Sphere (Option B):**
   - The conducting sphere initially has no net charge, but when brought close to a positively charged object, it will develop an induced negative charge on the side facing the nonconducting sphere and an equal positive charge on the opposite side. However, these charges are distributed such that the overall net charge of the conducting sphere remains zero because it is electrically neutral.

3. **Electrostatic Forces (Options C & D):**
   - The electrostatic force between two objects depends on their charges and the distance between them. Since the conducting sphere initially has no net charge, there will be an attractive force due to the induced negative charge on one side of the conducting sphere trying to attract the positive charge from the nonconducting sphere.

Given these points:

- Option (A) is correct because an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere.
- Option (B) is incorrect as the net charge on the conducting sphere remains zero.
- Options (C) and (D) are related to the nature of the force between the spheres, but since the conducting sphere has no net charge initially, it cannot repel the nonconducting sphere. Instead, there will be an attractive force due to induction.

Therefore, based on the principles of electrostatics and the given options:

The correct answer is (A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.",0.0,"Analyze the problem carefully, apply relevant principles or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer based on the given information.",20
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.1 \]
\[ U = 0.05 \, \text{J} \]

Therefore, the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V is:

"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, determine where this product is greater than zero. The roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \) are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero and we have already ensured that it is positive in these intervals, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the situation based on relevant legal principles, particularly focusing on the Declaratory Judgment Act and Supreme Court precedents.

1. **Understanding the Declaratory Judgment Act**: The Declaratory Judgment Act allows a person ""to have determined any actual controversy"" that is legally capable of determination with respect to their rights or status under federal law. This means that a declaratory judgment can be sought when there is an existing legal dispute or a genuine threat of enforcement.

2. **Supreme Court Precedents**: The Supreme Court has established certain principles regarding the use of declaratory judgments, particularly in cases where there is no immediate threat to the plaintiff's rights. For instance, in *Warth v. Seldin* (1975), the Court outlined that a case must have an actual controversy and not be speculative or hypothetical.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: This option suggests that declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions, which is based on equity and comity principles. However, this does not directly address whether there is a genuine threat to the law student's rights.
   - **Option B**: This option states that a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if they are not threatened with a state prosecution. While this might be true in some contexts, it doesn't align well with the need for an actual controversy or a genuine threat of enforcement.
   - **Option C**: This option suggests that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on the arrest of his companions and prior warnings. Given these facts, there is indeed a genuine threat to the law student's rights, making this option more plausible.
   - **Option D**: This option argues that declaratory relief would be premature because the law student’s fears are speculative. However, given the specific circumstances (arrests of his companions and prior warnings), it can be argued that there is a concrete threat.

4. **Conclusion**:
Given the facts provided and the need for an actual controversy or genuine threat to rights under Supreme Court precedents, Option C appears to be the most precise answer. The law student has shown a clear and present danger of enforcement against him based on the actions taken by his companions and prior warnings from the police.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**",1.0,"Analyze the problem carefully, apply relevant principles or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer based on the given information.",20
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:
