"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's break down the scenario and apply relevant concepts from electrostatics.

1. **Nonconducting Sphere with +Q Charge**: This sphere has a net positive charge of +Q. When brought close to another object (in this case, a neutral conducting sphere), it will induce charges on the surface of the conducting sphere due to the electric field created by the nonconducting sphere.

2. **Neutral Conducting Sphere**: A conductor distributes its charge such that the electric field inside is zero. This means any external electric field will cause charges to rearrange themselves on the surface, but not within the material itself.

3. **Induced Charges in a Conductor**:
   - When a positive charge (+Q) approaches a neutral conducting sphere, it will induce an equal and opposite (negative) charge –Q on one side of the conductor.
   - Simultaneously, the other side of the conductor will develop a +Q charge to maintain electrical neutrality overall.

4. **Electrostatic Forces**:
   - The positive charge (+Q) on the nonconducting sphere will attract the negative charges (–Q) that have been induced on the conducting sphere.
   - This attraction results in an electrostatic force between the two spheres, causing them to be attracted to each other.

Now let's evaluate the options:

(A) **An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
   - Incorrect: In a conductor, the electric field inside is zero due to the free movement of charges that rearrange themselves on the surface to cancel out any internal fields.

(B) **The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
   - Partially correct but not fully precise: The conducting sphere will indeed have an induced –Q charge on one side, but it will also have +Q charge on the other side due to the redistribution of charges for overall neutrality.

(C) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
   - Correct: Due to the positive charge (+Q) on the nonconducting sphere and the induced negative charge (–Q) on one side of the conducting sphere, there is a net attractive force between them.

(D) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
   - Incorrect: There is no repulsive force because the charges are opposite in nature (+Q and –Q).

Therefore, the most precise answer based on the information given is:

**(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**",0.0,"Analyze the question or context deeply, apply relevant concepts or calculations, eliminate irrelevant options, and select the most precise answer from those provided based on the information given.",15
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work required),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 0.005 J.",0.0,"Analyze the question or context deeply, apply relevant concepts or calculations, eliminate irrelevant options, and select the most precise answer from those provided based on the information given.",15
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedents and the specific circumstances presented.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that clarifies or declares one's rights under existing laws without ordering any action. The primary purpose is to provide clarity on the legal status of parties involved.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent**: The key Supreme Court case here is *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club*, 451 U.S. 287 (1981), which established that a declaratory judgment action can be brought to resolve an actual controversy, even if the plaintiff has not yet been prosecuted under the statute in question.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: This option suggests that the federal district court would dismiss the action because it interferes with existing state prosecutions. However, this is not supported by Supreme Court precedent.
   - **Option B**: This option states that a federal plaintiff may seek declaratory judgment even if they are not threatened with prosecution on the state statute. While this might be true in some contexts, it does not fully address the specific circumstances of the law student's case.
   - **Option C**: This option argues that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings. This aligns with *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club*, which allows for declaratory relief when there is a real and immediate threat of prosecution.
   - **Option D**: This option suggests that the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears are speculative. However, given the actual threats to his companions and prior warnings, this argument does not hold up.

4. **Conclusion**:
Based on Supreme Court precedent and the specific circumstances provided, the most precise answer is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly identifies that the law student has a legitimate basis to seek declaratory relief due to the real and immediate threat posed by the criminal statutes in question.",1.0,"Analyze the question or context deeply, apply relevant concepts or calculations, eliminate irrelevant options, and select the most precise answer from those provided based on the information given.",15
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers, and the denominator cannot be zero.

First, let's solve the inequality:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0. \]

We start by finding the roots of the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0 \). Factoring the quadratic expression gives us:
\[ (x-4)(x+1) = 0. \]
So, the roots are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \).

Next, we analyze the sign of the quadratic expression in the intervals determined by these roots: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

- For \( x < -1 \): Choose a test point, say \( x = -2 \). Then,
\[ (-2)^2 - 3(-2) - 4 = 4 + 6 - 4 = 6 > 0. \]
So, the expression is positive in the interval \( (-\infty, -1) \).

- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose a test point, say \( x = 0 \). Then,
\[ 0^2 - 3(0) - 4 = -4 < 0. \]
So, the expression is negative in the interval \( (-1, 4) \).

- For \( x > 4 \): Choose a test point, say \( x = 5 \). Then,
\[ 5^2 - 3(5) - 4 = 25 - 15 - 4 = 6 > 0. \]
So, the expression is positive in the interval \( (4, \infty) \).

Therefore, the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) holds for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \). This means that the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:
\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty). \]

Thus, the correct answer is:
\[

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:
