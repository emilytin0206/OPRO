"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a capacitor, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

Calculate step by step:
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-2} J \]
\[ U = 0.05 J \]

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the given scenario.

1. **Nonconducting Sphere with +Q Charge**: This sphere has a net positive charge of +Q. When brought close to another object (in this case, a neutral conducting sphere), it will induce charges on the surface of the conducting sphere due to the electric field created by the nonconducting sphere.

2. **Neutral Conducting Sphere**: A conductor distributes its charge such that the electric field inside is zero. This means any external electric field will cause the free electrons in the conductor to move, redistributing themselves until the net electric field inside the conductor is canceled out.

3. **Induced Charges on the Conducting Sphere**:
   - When a positive charge (+Q) approaches a neutral conducting sphere, it repels the free electrons in the conductor towards the side away from the nonconducting sphere.
   - This leaves an excess of positive charges (induced by the external field) on the side of the conducting sphere that is closest to the nonconducting sphere.

4. **Electrostatic Forces**:
   - The induced positive charge on one part of the conducting sphere will attract the +Q charge from the nonconducting sphere.
   - However, due to the overall neutral nature and the redistribution of charges within the conductor, there isn't a net external charge that would result in repulsion.

Now let's evaluate each option:

(A) **An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
- This is true because the nonconducting sphere with +Q charge creates an electric field around it, which induces charges on the surface of the conducting sphere.

(B) **The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
- This is incorrect. The conducting sphere will not have a net charge of -Q; instead, there will be induced positive and negative charges that cancel out inside the conductor but create an external field due to their redistribution.

(C) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
- This is true because the induced positive charge on one side of the conducting sphere will attract the +Q charge from the nonconducting sphere, leading to a net attractive force between them.

(D) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
- This is incorrect based on the analysis above; there is no net external charge that would cause repulsion.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",0.0,"Analyze the context thoroughly, apply relevant concepts or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on provided information, and select the most accurate answer.",5
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

So, we need to solve:

\[ (x-4)(x+1) > 0 \]

To find where this inequality holds true, we determine the roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied:

- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the inequality \( (x-4)(x+1) > 0 \) is satisfied in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

Next, we need to ensure that the denominator is not zero. The expression under the square root must be strictly greater than zero, so there are no additional restrictions from this part.

Therefore, combining these results, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedent. The key points to analyze include:

1. **Nature of Declaratory Judgment**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that determines the rights and obligations of parties without ordering any specific action or awarding damages.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent**: The most relevant case here is likely *O'Shea v. Littleton* (414 U.S. 488, 1974), where the Supreme Court established that a declaratory judgment should not be granted if there is no actual or imminent controversy.

3. **Threat of Enforcement**: The law student's companions were arrested for criminal trespass and loitering, which suggests that these statutes are being enforced against individuals who engage in similar activities. This provides some evidence of the threat of enforcement.

4. **Speculative Nature of Fears**: While the law student fears future arrest based on prior warnings and his companions' arrests, this fear is not necessarily speculative if there's a reasonable likelihood of prosecution under the same circumstances.

Given these points:

- Option (A) suggests that declaratory relief would be disallowed due to interference with state prosecutions. However, Supreme Court precedent does not support an absolute ban on declaratory judgments based solely on the potential for future enforcement.
  
- Option (B) is incorrect because it misinterprets *O'Shea v. Littleton*, which requires a genuine threat of enforcement rather than allowing any federal plaintiff to seek declaratory relief regardless of circumstances.

- Option (C) aligns with Supreme Court precedent by recognizing that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement, as evidenced by his companions' arrests and prior warnings. This option is consistent with the requirement for an actual or imminent controversy in *O'Shea v. Littleton*.

- Option (D) incorrectly dismisses the law student's fears as entirely speculative without considering the evidence provided by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings, which do indicate a reasonable likelihood of future enforcement.

Therefore, based on Supreme Court precedent and the context provided:

**The correct answer is (C): No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**",1.0,"Analyze the context thoroughly, apply relevant concepts or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on provided information, and select the most accurate answer.",5
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the numbers without any remainder.

The given orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.
