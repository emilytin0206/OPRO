"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"The correct answer is (C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.

Here’s an analysis based on Supreme Court precedent:

1. **Genuine Threat of Enforcement**: The Supreme Court has recognized that declaratory relief may be granted when there is a ""genuine threat"" of enforcement against the plaintiff. In cases like *Warth v. Seldin* (1975), the Court emphasized that a plaintiff must show more than just a hypothetical or speculative fear; they need to demonstrate a real and immediate danger.

2. **Prior Warnings and Arrests**: The fact that the law student's companions were arrested for criminal trespass and loitering, and that there have been prior warnings from the police, provides evidence of a genuine threat of enforcement against him as well. This is particularly relevant because it shows that the state has already acted against individuals engaging in similar conduct.

3. **Equity and Comity**: While equity and comity are important considerations, they do not necessarily preclude granting declaratory relief if there is a sufficient showing of a genuine threat. The Supreme Court's decision in *Warth v. Seldin* also noted that courts should be cautious about dismissing cases based on the potential for interference with state prosecutions unless such interference is clear and significant.

4. **Prematurity**: Prematurity is not necessarily a bar to declaratory relief, especially when there is an immediate threat of enforcement. The Supreme Court has recognized that declaratory judgments can provide necessary legal clarity even in situations where future enforcement might be speculative (see *Lesar v. North Side Hospital* (1976)).

Therefore, the law student's case meets the criteria for a genuine threat and thus qualifies for declaratory relief under these principles.",1.0,"Analyze the problem thoroughly, consider all relevant factors, and provide a precise answer.",1
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers, and the denominator cannot be zero.
2. We need to solve the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, let's factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

Next, we find the roots of the equation \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \):
\[ x = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1 \]

These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \). We need to test each interval to determine where the expression is positive.

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \):
  Choose a test point, say \( x = -2 \).
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \):
  Choose a test point, say \( x = 0 \).
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \):
  Choose a test point, say \( x = 5 \).
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

From the tests above, we see that \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

Therefore, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:
\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the given scenario.

1. **Induced Electric Field (Option A):**
   - When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere. This is because the presence of the charged nonconducting sphere will cause the free electrons in the conducting sphere to redistribute themselves, creating an induced electric field.

2. **Net Electric Charge on the Conducting Sphere (Option B):**
   - The neutral conducting sphere will not develop a net electric charge of –Q. Instead, it will experience a redistribution of its charges such that the side closer to the nonconducting sphere will have a slight positive charge and the opposite side will have a slight negative charge due to the induced field.

3. **Electrostatic Forces (Options C & D):**
   - The spheres will experience an electrostatic force, but it is important to determine whether this force is attractive or repulsive.
     - Since the nonconducting sphere has a net positive charge +Q and the conducting sphere initially had no net charge, the induced charges on the conducting sphere will create an electric field that attracts the positive charge of the nonconducting sphere. Therefore, there will be an electrostatic attraction between the two spheres.

Given this analysis:

- **Option A** is correct in stating that an electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
- **Option B** is incorrect because the conducting sphere does not develop a net charge of –Q; it redistributes its charges to induce fields.
- **Option C** is correct as the spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction due to the positive charge on one and the induced negative charge on the side closer to the nonconducting sphere.

Therefore, the most precise answer based on the given options is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",1.0,"Analyze the problem thoroughly, consider all relevant factors, and provide a precise answer.",1
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

Calculate step by step:
1. Calculate \( V^2 \):
   \[ V^2 = (100 V)^2 = 10000 V^2 \]
   
2. Multiply the capacitance by \( V^2 \):
   \[ C \times V^2 = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \times 10000 V^2 = 10 \times 10^{-2} J = 0.1 J \]
   
3. Finally, multiply by \( \frac{1}{2} \):
   \[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.1 J = 0.05 J \]

Therefore, the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V is:

\[ \boxed{0.05 J} \]

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To determine the minimum positive number of days after which planets X, Y, and Z will be aligned with each other and the sun again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their orbital periods. The orbital periods are given as follows:

- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

The LCM of these numbers will give us the number of days after which all three planets will be in the same relative positions with respect to the sun.

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in these factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Now, we multiply these together to find the LCM:

\[
LCM = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[
   2^3 = 8
   \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[
   3^3 = 27
   \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[
   5^2 = 25
   \]

4. Multiply these results together:
   \[
   LCM = 8 \times 27 \times 25
   \]

First, multiply 8 and 27:

\[
8 \times 27 = 216
\]

Then, multiply the result by 25:

\[
216 \times 25 = 5400
\]

Thus, the least common multiple of 360, 450, and 540 is 5400.

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:
