"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To solve this problem, let's analyze each option based on the principles of electrostatics and the behavior of conductors in the presence of charges.

1. **Option (A): An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
   - When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, an electric field due to the nonconducting sphere will indeed induce charges on the surface of the conducting sphere. However, in a conductor, these induced charges rearrange themselves such that the internal electric field within the conductor becomes zero.

2. **Option (B): The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
   - This is incorrect because the total charge must be conserved. Since the neutral conducting sphere initially has no net charge and only experiences an induced charge distribution, it cannot acquire a net charge of –Q without violating conservation of charge.

3. **Option (C): The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
   - A positive charge (+Q) on one sphere will induce a negative charge (-Q) on the side of the neutral conducting sphere facing +Q and a positive charge (+Q) on the opposite side. This setup results in an attractive force between the two spheres due to the induced charges.

4. **Option (D): The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
   - This is incorrect because, as explained above, the induced charges on the conducting sphere will result in a net attraction rather than repulsion.

Given this analysis, the most accurate answer based on the principles of electrostatics and charge induction in conductors is:

**The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**

Therefore, the correct choice is **(C)**.",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement carefully, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on given information, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",19
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, determine where this product is greater than zero. The roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \) are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero and we have already ensured that it is positive in these intervals, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider relevant legal principles, particularly those related to declaratory judgment actions and the standards for granting such relief. The key Supreme Court precedent here is likely derived from the Declaratory Judgment Act (D.J.A.) of 1934, which was designed to provide a means for individuals to seek clarification on their rights without having to wait until they are actually threatened with prosecution.

The correct answer can be determined by analyzing each option in light of these principles:

(A) This option suggests that the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and thus should be disallowed. While this is a valid concern, it does not directly address whether the law student has standing to seek such relief based on his fears.

(B) This option states that a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute. However, this overlooks the specific circumstances of the case and the need for a genuine threat of enforcement against the law student himself.

(C) This option correctly identifies that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement based on the arrest of his companions and prior warnings. The Supreme Court has recognized that declaratory relief may be granted when there is a ""genuine"" or ""real and immediate"" threat of enforcement, even if it does not directly involve the plaintiff.

(D) This option argues that the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears are speculative. While this might seem plausible at first glance, it overlooks the fact that the law student has already experienced a similar situation with his companions and is thus not entirely speculating about future enforcement actions.

Given these considerations, the most accurate answer is:

(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings. This option correctly applies the legal standards for granting declaratory relief based on the Supreme Court's precedents regarding standing and the need for a ""real and immediate"" threat.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C).",1.0,"Analyze the problem statement carefully, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on given information, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",19
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work required to charge the capacitor),
- \( C \) is the capacitance of the capacitor,
- \( V \) is the potential difference across the capacitor.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Now we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

First, calculate \( (100 V)^2 \):

\[ (100 V)^2 = 10000 V^2 \]

Now substitute this back into the equation:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times 10000 V^2 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 \times 10^{-3} J \]
\[ U = 50 \times 10^{-3} J \]
\[ U = 0.05 J \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

\[ 2^3 = 8 \]
\[ 3^3 = 27 \]
\[ 5^2 = 25 \]

Multiplying these together:
\[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
\[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.
