"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To solve this problem, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Understanding the Setup**: We have two spheres - one nonconducting with a net positive charge +Q and another neutral conducting sphere of the same radius.

2. **Electric Field Induction in Conductors**:
   - When a charged object is brought close to a conductor, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. The induced charges rearrange themselves such that they create an electric field that opposes the external field.
   - In this case, when the positively charged nonconducting sphere (+Q) approaches the neutral conducting sphere, the side of the conducting sphere closest to +Q will develop a negative charge due to induction (opposite to the external field), and the far side will develop a positive charge.

3. **Analyzing Each Option**:
   - **(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere**: This is true because when a charged object approaches a conductor, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor.
   - **(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q**: This is incorrect. While there will be an induced negative charge on one side and positive charge on the other side, these charges are not equal in magnitude to +Q; they only partially cancel out the external field but do not result in a net charge.
   - **(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction**: This is true. The induced negative charge on the side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere (+Q) will attract the positive charges, leading to an overall attractive force between the two spheres.
   - **(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion**: This is incorrect because the induced charges on the conducting sphere will create a field that attracts the +Q charge of the nonconducting sphere.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Both (A) and (C) are correct, but since we need to select the most accurate answer based on the given options, option (C) is more directly related to the net effect between the two spheres.
   
Therefore, the best answer is:

**(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement meticulously, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on given information, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",19
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

### Step 1: Factorize the quadratic expression
The quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0 \) can be factored as:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

### Step 2: Determine where the factors are zero
Set each factor to zero to find the critical points:
\[ x - 4 = 0 \implies x = 4 \]
\[ x + 1 = 0 \implies x = -1 \]

These points divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 3: Test each interval
We need to determine where the product \((x-4)(x+1)\) is positive. We can test a point in each interval:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \), choose \( x = -2 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]

- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \), choose \( x = 0 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \), choose \( x = 5 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

### Step 4: Combine the results
The expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is satisfied in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 5: Consider the denominator
Since the function includes a square root in the denominator, we must ensure that the expression inside the square root is strictly positive. Therefore, we exclude the points where it equals zero:
\[ x = -1 \text{ and } x = 4 \]

Thus, the domain of \( f(x) \) is the union of the intervals where the expression under the square root is positive:
\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedents and the specific circumstances presented.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that determines the rights of parties without ordering any action or providing relief. The primary purpose is to resolve legal disputes before they lead to more serious consequences.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent**: In *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club*, 451 U.S. 287 (1981), the Supreme Court held that a declaratory judgment action can be brought even if there is no immediate threat of prosecution, as long as the plaintiff can show a ""real and immediate"" controversy.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: This option suggests that the federal district court would dismiss the action because it interferes with existing state prosecutions. However, this reasoning does not align with the Supreme Court's stance in *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club*, which allows for declaratory judgments even when there is no immediate threat of prosecution.
   - **Option B**: This option states that a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment regardless of whether they are threatened by state prosecutions. While this statement is generally true, it does not fully address the specific circumstances presented in the scenario.
   - **Option C**: This option claims that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on the arrest of his companions and prior warnings. Given the Supreme Court's precedent allowing declaratory judgments when there is a ""real and immediate"" controversy, this option seems to align well with the facts provided.
   - **Option D**: This option suggests that the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student’s fears are speculative. However, the arrest of his companions and prior warnings provide a basis for a ""real and immediate"" threat, making this option less accurate.

4. **Conclusion**:
Based on the analysis, the most accurate answer is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This conclusion is supported by the Supreme Court's precedent allowing declaratory judgments when there is a ""real and immediate"" controversy, which in this case is demonstrated by the arrests and warnings.",1.0,"Analyze the problem statement meticulously, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on given information, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",19
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3 = 8\)
2. Calculate \(3^3 = 27\)
3. Calculate \(5^2 = 25\)

Then multiply these together:
\[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
\[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.
