"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done to charge the capacitor),
- \( C \) is the capacitance of the capacitor,
- \( V \) is the potential difference across the capacitor.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Now we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

First, calculate \( V^2 \):

\[ V^2 = (100 V)^2 = 10000 V^2 \]

Now substitute this back into the equation:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} J \]
\[ U = 0.005 J \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, we factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

So, the inequality becomes:

\[ (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \]

To solve this inequality, we find the roots of the equation \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

Next, we test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the inequality \( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \) holds for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero and we have already excluded the points where the expression under the square root is non-positive, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the scenario described.

1. **Nonconducting Sphere with +Q Charge**: This sphere has a net positive charge of +Q. When brought close to another object (in this case, a neutral conducting sphere), it will induce charges on the surface of the conducting sphere due to the electric field created by the nonconducting sphere.

2. **Conducting Sphere Initially Neutral**: A conducting sphere initially has no net charge. However, when placed in an electric field, free electrons within the conductor can move and rearrange themselves to counteract the external field as much as possible.

3. **Induced Charges on Conducting Sphere**:
   - When a positive charge is brought close to one side of a neutral conducting sphere, the electrons in the conductor will be repelled by the positive charge and move towards the opposite side.
   - This movement of charges results in an induced negative charge on the side closest to the nonconducting sphere and an induced positive charge on the far side.

4. **Electrostatic Forces**:
   - The induced negative charge on the side of the conducting sphere nearest to the nonconducting sphere will experience a repulsive force from the +Q charge.
   - The induced positive charge on the opposite side of the conducting sphere will experience an attractive force towards the +Q charge.

5. **Net Electrostatic Force Between Spheres**:
   - Since the induced charges are distributed such that there is both attraction and repulsion, the overall net electrostatic force between the two spheres can be analyzed.
   - The primary interaction here is the attraction due to the induced negative charge on one side of the conducting sphere being attracted by the +Q charge.

Given these points:

- **Option (A)**: An electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere, but this is a general consequence and not specific to the electrostatic force between the spheres.
- **Option (B)**: The conducting sphere does develop an induced net charge of –Q on one side, but it remains neutral overall because charges are just redistributed. Therefore, this option is incorrect as stated.
- **Option (C)**: The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction due to the induced negative charge on the side closest to the +Q charge being attracted by the positive charge.
- **Option (D)**: There would be no repulsion between the spheres because there are no like charges that are free to move and create a net repulsive force.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**",0.0,"Analyze the question or provided context meticulously, apply necessary theories or calculations, eliminate incorrect options based on given information, and select the most precise answer from those available.",6
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedents and the specific circumstances presented.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that clarifies or declares the rights of parties without ordering any action or awarding damages. The primary purpose is to resolve legal uncertainties before they lead to actual disputes.

2. **Supreme Court Precedents on Declaratory Judgments**:
   - In *Warth v. Seldin* (1975), the Supreme Court established that a declaratory judgment action must meet certain criteria, including a ""real and immediate"" threat of enforcement against the plaintiff.
   - In *Lesar v. Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co.* (1982), the Court further clarified that a declaratory judgment is not appropriate if it would interfere with ongoing state prosecutions or disrupt the normal course of judicial proceedings.

3. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **Option A**: This option suggests dismissing the action due to interference with existing state prosecutions, which aligns with *Lesar v. Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co.* However, this is not entirely accurate because the law student has shown a genuine threat of enforcement against him.
   - **Option B**: This option states that a federal plaintiff may seek declaratory judgment regardless of current prosecution threats. While generally true, it does not fully consider the specific circumstances and potential interference with state proceedings.
   - **Option C**: This option correctly identifies that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings. This aligns well with *Warth v. Seldin* criteria for a ""real and immediate"" threat.
   - **Option D**: This option suggests dismissing the action as premature due to speculative fears, which does not accurately reflect the law student's demonstrated situation.

Given these considerations, the most precise answer is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly applies the legal principles to the specific facts presented in the scenario.",1.0,"Analyze the question or provided context meticulously, apply necessary theories or calculations, eliminate incorrect options based on given information, and select the most precise answer from those available.",6
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM will give us the minimum number of days after which all three planets will be in their initial positions relative to each other again.

The given orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

\[ 2^3 = 8 \]
\[ 3^3 = 27 \]
\[ 5^2 = 25 \]

Multiplying these together:
\[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
\[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:

\(\boxed{5400}\)

So, the correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,"Analyze the question or provided context meticulously, apply necessary theories or calculations, eliminate incorrect options based on given information, and select the most precise answer from those available.",6
