"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's break down each option and apply relevant principles from electrostatics.

### Given Information:
- A nonconducting sphere with a net electric charge \( +Q \).
- A neutral conducting sphere of the same radius as the nonconducting sphere.
- The nonconducting sphere is brought close to the conducting sphere.

### Analysis:

1. **Option (A): An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
   - When a charged object approaches a conductor, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. These induced charges rearrange themselves such that the electric field inside the conductor remains zero.
   - This is due to the free electrons in the conductor being able to move and redistribute themselves in response to the external electric field.

2. **Option (B): The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
   - A neutral conducting sphere cannot have a net charge; it must remain electrically neutral overall.
   - However, charges can be induced on its surface, but these charges do not add up to give the conductor a net charge.

3. **Option (C): The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
   - An object with a positive charge (+Q) will attract any negative charges that might be present in the conducting sphere.
   - Since the conducting sphere is initially neutral, it has no inherent net charge to repel or attract the nonconducting sphere directly. However, due to induction, there can be an attraction between the spheres.

4. **Option (D): The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
   - Repulsion would occur if both objects had like charges (both positive or both negative).
   - Since one object is positively charged and the other is initially neutral, no net charge transfer has occurred to make them repel each other.

### Conclusion:
- Option (A) is correct because an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere.
- Option (B) is incorrect as a conductor cannot have a net charge if it was originally neutral.
- Option (C) could be true in terms of attraction, but this is not necessarily the most precise answer given the principles involved.
- Option (D) is incorrect because there will be no repulsion.

Therefore, the most precise and correct answer based on the provided information is:

**The electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**

So, the final answer is: **(A)**",0.0,"Analyze the question in depth, apply relevant principles or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer based on the provided information.",10
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider principles from constitutional law, specifically related to declaratory judgment actions and the balance between federal and state interests.

### Analysis:

1. **Nature of Declaratory Judgment Action**: A declaratory judgment is a legal action in which a court determines the rights of parties without ordering either side to take any action. The purpose here is for the law student to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent and Principles**:
   - **Equity and Comity**: The principle that federal courts should not interfere with ongoing state prosecutions unless absolutely necessary.
   - **Mootness and Ripeness**: A case is considered moot if it cannot be resolved by a court's decision, or ripeness concerns whether the issue presented is sufficiently concrete to warrant judicial resolution.

3. **Specific Facts**:
   - The law student has not been arrested but fears future arrest based on his companions' experience.
   - There are prior warnings and arrests indicating potential enforcement of state statutes against similar activities.

### Evaluating Each Option:

- **Option (A)**: This option suggests that the declaratory relief would be dismissed due to interference with existing state prosecutions. While this is a valid concern, it does not fully address whether the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement.
  
- **Option (B)**: This option states that a federal plaintiff may seek declaratory judgment even if not directly threatened by a state prosecution. However, the Supreme Court has been cautious about issuing advisory opinions and generally requires some concrete threat to justify such actions.

- **Option (C)**: This option argues that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings. The Supreme Court has recognized that declaratory judgments may be granted when there is a ""real and immediate"" threat, which seems applicable here.
  
- **Option (D)**: This suggests that the relief would be premature because the law student's fears are speculative. While this could be argued, it does not fully consider the concrete threats faced by the companions.

### Conclusion:

Given the Supreme Court’s emphasis on a ""real and immediate"" threat for declaratory judgments, and considering the specific facts of the case (prior warnings and arrests), **Option (C)** is the most precise answer. The law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on his companions' experience.

**Final Answer: (C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**",1.0,"Analyze the question in depth, apply relevant principles or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer based on the provided information.",10
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, determine where this product is greater than zero. The roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \) are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero and we have already ensured that it is positive in these intervals, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:
