"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"The correct answer is (C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.

Explanation:

This scenario involves the application of principles related to declaratory judgment actions under federal law. Specifically, it touches on the Declaratory Judgment Act (28 U.S.C. § 2201), which allows a person ""to have determined any actual controversy"" that is legally capable of being decided by the courts.

The Supreme Court's precedent in cases such as Warth v. Seldin (1975) and Golden State Transit Corp. v. City of Los Angeles (1982) establishes criteria for granting declaratory relief, including a genuine threat or risk of enforcement against the plaintiff. In this case:

- The law student's companions were arrested for criminal trespass and loitering.
- There have been prior warnings from the police to stop their activities.

These facts demonstrate that there is a real and immediate danger that the law student could be prosecuted under the same statutes, thus meeting the criteria for a genuine threat of enforcement. Therefore, the federal district court would not dismiss the declaratory judgment action based on this evidence.

Option (A) is incorrect because while it mentions interference with state prosecutions, which can be a factor in some cases, it does not address the specific facts that support the law student's claim.
Option (B) is incorrect as it incorrectly states that a federal plaintiff cannot seek declaratory relief if they are not threatened by a state prosecution, which is not the case here.
Option (D) is incorrect because while it mentions speculative fears, the prior warnings and arrests of his companions provide sufficient evidence to establish a genuine threat.

Thus, based on Supreme Court precedent, the correct answer is (C).",1.0,"Analyze the problem carefully, use relevant concepts or calculations, and select the most accurate answer from the provided options.",3
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the given scenario.

1. **Induced Electric Field (Option A):**
   - When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere. This is because the presence of the charged nonconducting sphere will cause charges in the conducting sphere to rearrange themselves due to electrostatic induction.

2. **Net Electric Charge on the Conducting Sphere (Option B):**
   - The conducting sphere initially has no net charge, but when brought close to a positively charged object, it will not develop a net electric charge of –Q. Instead, charges within the conductor will rearrange themselves such that an equal and opposite charge is induced on the side facing the nonconducting sphere, while the other side will have an equal positive charge. This ensures that the overall charge distribution in the conductor remains zero.

3. **Electrostatic Forces (Options C & D):**
   - The electrostatic force between two objects depends on their charges and the distance between them. Since one object has a net positive charge +Q, and the other is initially neutral but will have induced charges, there will be an attractive force between the spheres due to the opposite charges that are induced.

Given these points:

- Option A is correct because an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere.
- Option B is incorrect as the net charge on the conducting sphere does not become –Q; instead, it becomes polarized with equal and opposite charges on its surface.
- Options C and D both describe electrostatic forces but differ in their nature. Since one object has a positive charge and the other will have an induced negative charge facing it, there is an attractive force between them.

Therefore, the most accurate answer from the provided options is:

**(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**",1.0,"Analyze the problem carefully, use relevant concepts or calculations, and select the most accurate answer from the provided options.",3
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that the expression under the square root is positive and that the denominator is not zero. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Identify where the denominator is defined:**
   The denominator of \( f(x) \) is \( \sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 4} \). For the expression under the square root to be valid, it must be greater than zero (since a square root cannot be in the denominator if it's zero or negative).

2. **Solve the inequality:**
   We need to solve \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).
   
   First, factorize the quadratic expression:
   \[
   x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1)
   \]
   
   Now we find the roots of the equation \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \).

3. **Determine the intervals:**
   The roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \). We need to test each interval to see where the expression is positive.

   - For \( x < -1 \): Choose a test point, say \( x = -2 \).
     \[
     (x - 4)(x + 1) = (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0
     \]
   - For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose a test point, say \( x = 0 \).
     \[
     (x - 4)(x + 1) = (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0
     \]
   - For \( x > 4 \): Choose a test point, say \( x = 5 \).
     \[
     (x - 4)(x + 1) = (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0
     \]

   Therefore, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \) is positive in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

4. **Combine the results:**
   The domain of \( f(x) \) must exclude points where the denominator is zero or undefined. Since we need the expression under the square root to be positive, the domain is:
   \[
   (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty)
   \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the numbers without any remainder.

The given orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

To find the LCM, we can use their prime factorizations:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **LCM Calculation**:
   The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers.
   - For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Therefore, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Calculating this product step-by-step:
- First, calculate \(2^3\):
  \[ 2^3 = 8 \]
- Next, calculate \(3^3\):
  \[ 3^3 = 27 \]
- Then, calculate \(5^2\):
  \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

Now multiply these together:
\[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
\[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Thus, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
