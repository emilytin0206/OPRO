"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the given scenario.

1. **Induced Electric Field (Option A):**
   - When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere. This is because the presence of the charged nonconducting sphere will cause charges in the conducting sphere to rearrange themselves due to electrostatic induction.

2. **Net Electric Charge on the Conducting Sphere (Option B):**
   - A neutral conducting sphere does not have a net charge, and when brought close to another charged object, it will redistribute its charges but will not acquire a net charge of –Q or +Q. The redistribution is such that the side closer to the nonconducting sphere will develop an excess negative charge, while the opposite side will develop an equal positive charge, maintaining overall neutrality.

3. **Electrostatic Forces (Options C and D):**
   - Since one sphere has a net positive charge (+Q) and the other remains neutral but experiences induced charges due to induction, there will be an electrostatic force between them. The positive charge on the nonconducting sphere will attract the negative charges that are induced in the conducting sphere, leading to an overall attractive force.

Given these considerations:

- Option A is correct because an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere.
- Option B is incorrect as the conducting sphere does not acquire a net charge of –Q or +Q; it redistributes its charges but remains neutral.
- Options C and D are related to the nature of the force between the spheres, which is attractive due to the induced negative charges on one side of the conducting sphere.

Therefore, the most accurate answer from the provided options is:

**(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**",0.0,"Analyze the problem context thoroughly, apply relevant principles or calculations as necessary, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",7
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 0.005 J.",0.0,"Analyze the problem context thoroughly, apply relevant principles or calculations as necessary, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",7
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, determine where this product is greater than zero. The roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \) are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero and we have already ensured that it is positive in these intervals, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider principles from constitutional law, particularly regarding declaratory judgment actions and the balance between federal and state interests.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a legal remedy that allows a court to declare the rights of parties without ordering any specific action or awarding damages. The primary purpose is to resolve legal uncertainties before they lead to actual disputes.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent and Federalism**: The Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of federalism, which involves respecting state sovereignty while ensuring that federal courts can provide necessary relief when there are genuine threats of enforcement against individuals.

3. **Genuine Threat of Enforcement**: In cases where a declaratory judgment is sought to avoid future harm or enforcement actions, the court will consider whether the plaintiff has shown a ""genuine threat"" of enforcement. This means the plaintiff must demonstrate that they have been placed in a position where they are likely to face legal action.

4. **Equity and Comity**: Courts also consider principles of equity (fairness) and comity (respect for state laws and judicial systems). Dismissing such actions can be seen as interfering with ongoing or potential state prosecutions, which might not align with the federal court's role in providing relief.

Given these considerations:

- Option **(A)** suggests that declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions. While this is a valid concern, it does not fully address whether the law student has shown a genuine threat of enforcement against himself.
  
- Option **(B)** states that a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute. This is generally true but does not directly address the specific circumstances presented.

- Option **(C)** indicates that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings. This aligns well with the principle that a plaintiff must demonstrate a real, imminent risk to justify seeking declaratory relief.

- Option **(D)** suggests that the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears are speculative. However, given the specific circumstances (arrest of companions and prior warnings), this option does not fully consider the evidence presented.

Considering these points, the most accurate answer is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This choice acknowledges both the need for showing a genuine threat and the specific circumstances that support such a claim.",0.0,"Analyze the problem context thoroughly, apply relevant principles or calculations as necessary, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",7
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM will give us the minimum number of days after which all three planets will be in their initial positions relative to each other again.

The given orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:
