"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the numerator and the denominator are defined, with special attention given to the square root in the denominator. Specifically, the expression under the square root must be positive because the square root of a negative number is not real, and the denominator cannot be zero.

1. **Identify where the denominator is defined:**
   The denominator is \(\sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 4}\). For this to be defined and non-zero, the expression inside the square root must be positive:
   \[
   x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0
   \]

2. **Solve the inequality \(x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0\):**
   First, factorize the quadratic expression:
   \[
   x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1)
   \]
   So, we need to solve:
   \[
   (x-4)(x+1) > 0
   \]

3. **Determine the intervals where the product is positive:**
   The roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \) are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals:
   - \( (-\infty, -1) \)
   - \( (-1, 4) \)
   - \( (4, \infty) \)

   We test a point in each interval to determine where the product is positive:
   - For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \), choose \( x = -2 \):
     \[
     (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0
     \]
   - For \( x \in (-1, 4) \), choose \( x = 0 \):
     \[
     (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0
     \]
   - For \( x \in (4, \infty) \), choose \( x = 5 \):
     \[
     (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0
     \]

   Therefore, the expression \( (x-4)(x+1) > 0 \) is true for:
   \[
   (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty)
   \]

4. **Combine with the domain of the function:**
   The function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is defined where the denominator is positive and non-zero. Thus, the domain is:
   \[
   (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty)
   \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

Calculate step by step:
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-2} J \]
\[ U = 0.05 J \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider relevant legal principles, particularly those related to declaratory judgment actions and the standards for obtaining such relief. The key points from Supreme Court precedent that apply here include:

1. **Rooker-Feldman Doctrine**: This doctrine generally bars federal district courts from hearing cases involving state court judgments or claims that are inextricably intertwined with pending state proceedings.

2. **Declaratory Judgment Act (DJA)**: Under 28 U.S.C. § 2201, a declaratory judgment can be sought by any party who has a ""real and immediate"" controversy over the validity of a statute or its application to them.

3. **Standing**: A plaintiff must have standing to bring a case, which requires that they show a concrete and particularized injury that is likely redressable by a favorable court decision.

Given these principles:

- Option (A) suggests that declaratory relief would be dismissed due to interference with existing state prosecutions. This aligns with the Rooker-Feldman doctrine but does not fully address whether there's an immediate threat or concrete injury for the law student.
  
- Option (B) states that a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if they are not directly threatened by a state prosecution, which is generally true under DJA standards.

- Option (C) indicates that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings. This aligns with the requirement for standing to demonstrate a concrete injury or threat.

- Option (D) suggests dismissal due to premature nature, which would be applicable if there were no immediate or imminent threat to the plaintiff's rights.

Considering these points:

The most accurate answer is **(C)**: The law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings. This demonstrates that he has standing based on an actual injury or threat, which meets the criteria for seeking declaratory relief under the DJA.

Therefore, the federal district court would not dismiss the declaratory judgment action based on the law student's showing of a genuine threat of enforcement against him.",1.0,"Analyze the context thoroughly, apply relevant theories or laws as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most accurate answer based on the provided information.",11
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the scenario described.

1. **Induced Electric Field (Option A):**
   - When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere. This is because the presence of the charged nonconducting sphere will cause charges in the conducting sphere to rearrange themselves due to electrostatic induction.

2. **Net Electric Charge on the Conducting Sphere (Option B):**
   - A neutral conducting sphere does not have a net charge, and when brought close to another charged object, it will redistribute its free electrons but will not acquire an overall net charge of –Q. The charges will rearrange themselves such that the side closer to the +Q sphere will have more negative charges, and the opposite side will have more positive charges, but the total charge on the conducting sphere remains zero.

3. **Electrostatic Forces (Options C & D):**
   - According to Coulomb's Law, like charges repel each other, and unlike charges attract each other.
   - The nonconducting sphere with a net +Q will induce negative charges on the side of the conducting sphere that is closer to it, and positive charges on the opposite side. This means there will be an overall attractive force between the two spheres because one has a net positive charge (+Q) and the other has induced negative charges (–Q).

Given this analysis:

- Option A is correct as an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere.
- Option B is incorrect since the conducting sphere does not acquire a net charge of –Q; it redistributes its charges but remains neutral overall.
- Options C and D are related to electrostatic forces, but because one sphere has a net positive charge and the other has an induced negative charge on the side closer, there will be an attractive force between them.

Therefore, based on the principles of electrostatics and the behavior of conductors in the presence of charged objects:

The most accurate answer is (C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",1.0,"Analyze the context thoroughly, apply relevant theories or laws as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most accurate answer based on the provided information.",11
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

\[ 2^3 = 8 \]
\[ 3^3 = 27 \]
\[ 5^2 = 25 \]

Multiplying these together:
\[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
\[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:

\(\boxed{5400}\)

So, the correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,"Analyze the context thoroughly, apply relevant theories or laws as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most accurate answer based on the provided information.",11
