"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

So, we need to solve:

\[ (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \]

To find the intervals where this inequality holds true, we determine the roots of the equation \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

Next, we test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the inequality \( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \) is satisfied in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero, we exclude the points where the expression under the square root equals zero, which are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \). Therefore, the domain of the function is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider principles from constitutional law, specifically related to declaratory judgment actions and the balance between federal and state interests.

### Analysis:

1. **Declaratory Judgment Act (DJA) - 28 U.S.C. § 2201**: This act allows a person ""to have determined any question of construction of an act of Congress, or [of] any treaty or statute of, or commission created by, the United States"" and to obtain a declaration of rights.

2. **Supreme Court Precedents**:
   - **Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Co., 421 U.S. 723 (1975)**: The Supreme Court held that declaratory judgments are not available when they would interfere with pending or impending state prosecutions.
   - **Pennhurst State School & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89 (1984)**: This case further emphasized the principle of comity and equity in federal court actions that might interfere with ongoing state proceedings.

3. **Genuine Threat of Enforcement**:
   - The law student's companions were arrested for criminal trespass and loitering, which suggests a genuine threat of enforcement against him as well.
   - Prior warnings from the police also indicate a potential future arrest if he continues his activities.

### Evaluating Each Option:

- **(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**
  - This option aligns well with Supreme Court precedents like Blue Chip Stamps and Pennhurst State School & Hosp., which emphasize that federal courts should not issue declarations that might interfere with ongoing or impending state prosecutions.

- **(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.**
  - This option does not consider the principle of comity and equity as established by Supreme Court precedents. It incorrectly suggests that the law student can always seek declaratory relief regardless of the potential for interference.

- **(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**
  - While this option acknowledges the existence of a genuine threat, it does not address the principle that federal courts should avoid actions that might interfere with state prosecutions.

- **(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.**
  - This option incorrectly suggests that the law student’s fears are speculative and does not consider the Supreme Court’s emphasis on comity and equity in such cases.

### Conclusion:

The most accurate answer is **(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.** This option correctly applies the relevant legal principles from Supreme Court precedents to the given scenario.",0.0,"Analyze the question in detail, use relevant principles or perform calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",18
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's break down the scenario and apply relevant principles from electrostatics.

### Scenario:
- A nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge \(+Q\) is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Induced Charges in Conductors:**
   - When a charged object (in this case, the nonconducting sphere) approaches a conductor, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. The side of the conductor closest to the charge will develop an induced negative charge, and the far side will develop an induced positive charge.

2. **Electric Field in Conductors:**
   - In a conductor at electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the material is zero. This means that any external electric fields are canceled out by the internal charges rearranging themselves to create an opposing field.

3. **Electrostatic Forces Between Charged Objects:**
   - Like charges repel each other, and opposite charges attract each other.
   
### Analysis of Each Option:

- **(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
  - This is true because when a charged object approaches a conductor, it induces an electric field that causes charges to rearrange on the surface of the conductor.

- **(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
  - This statement is incorrect. While there will be induced charges on the surface of the conducting sphere (negative near the nonconducting sphere and positive far away), these induced charges do not result in a net charge for the entire conductor. The total charge remains zero because the conductor was initially neutral.

- **(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
  - This is true. The nonconducting sphere with \(+Q\) will induce a negative charge on the side of the conducting sphere closest to it, and this induced negative charge will attract the positive charge on the nonconducting sphere.

- **(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
  - This is incorrect because there are no like charges between the two spheres that would result in repulsion. Instead, opposite charges (induced negative and actual positive) will attract each other.

### Conclusion:
The most accurate answer based on the principles of electrostatics is:

**(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**",0.0,"Analyze the question in detail, use relevant principles or perform calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",18
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

First, calculate \( V^2 \):

\[ V^2 = (100 V)^2 = 10000 V^2 \]

Now substitute this back into the equation:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} J \]
\[ U = 0.005 J \]

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Identify the Highest Powers of Each Prime**:
   - For \(2\): The highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\): The highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\): The highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

3. **Calculate the LCM**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2
   \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     - \(2^3 = 8\)
     - \(3^3 = 27\)
     - \(5^2 = 25\)

4. **Multiply the Results**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 8 \times 27 \times 25
   \]
   - First, multiply 8 and 27:
     \[
     8 \times 27 = 216
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by 25:
     \[
     216 \times 25 = 5400
     \]

Thus, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.
