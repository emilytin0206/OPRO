"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedent. The key points to analyze include:

1. **Nature of Declaratory Judgment**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that determines the rights and obligations of parties without ordering any specific action or awarding damages.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent**: The most relevant case here is likely *O'Shea v. Littleton* (414 U.S. 488, 1974), where the Supreme Court established that a declaratory judgment should not be granted if there is no actual or imminent controversy.

3. **Threat of Enforcement**: The law student's companions were arrested for criminal trespass and loitering, which suggests that these statutes are being enforced against individuals who engage in similar activities. This could imply a genuine threat to the law student as well.

4. **Speculative Nature of Fears**: While the law student fears future arrest based on prior warnings and his companions' arrests, this fear is not entirely speculative because it has precedent and a basis in reality.

Given these points:

- Option (A) suggests that declaratory relief would be disallowed due to interference with existing state prosecutions. This could apply if there were ongoing criminal proceedings against the law student, but since he was not arrested, this does not seem applicable.
  
- Option (B) states that a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even without a direct threat of prosecution. However, the Supreme Court's precedent in *O'Shea v. Littleton* suggests otherwise.

- Option (C) indicates that there is a genuine threat to the law student based on his companions' arrests and prior warnings. This aligns with the legal principle that a declaratory judgment can be sought when there is an actual or imminent controversy, which seems to be present in this case.

- Option (D) suggests that the relief would be premature because fears are speculative. However, given the concrete actions of the police and the arrests of his companions, these fears cannot be entirely dismissed as speculative.

Therefore, based on Supreme Court precedent and the context provided:

The correct answer is **(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**",1.0,"Analyze the context of the question thoroughly, apply relevant knowledge or calculations, eliminate incorrect options based on the provided information, and select the most accurate answer.",11
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ E = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( E \) is the energy (work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ E = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

Calculate step by step:
\[ E = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]
\[ E = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]
\[ E = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.01 \]

"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, determine where this product is greater than zero. The roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \) are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero and we have already ensured that it is positive in these intervals, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the given scenario.

1. **Induced Electric Field (Option A):**
   - When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere. This is because the presence of the charged nonconducting sphere will cause charges in the conducting sphere to rearrange themselves due to electrostatic induction.

2. **Net Electric Charge on the Conducting Sphere (Option B):**
   - The conducting sphere initially has no net charge, but when brought close to a positively charged object, it will not acquire an equal and opposite charge of –Q. Instead, charges within the conductor will rearrange themselves such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. This means positive charges on the side facing the nonconducting sphere will be pushed away from the surface towards the back, while negative charges will move to the front.

3. **Electrostatic Forces Between the Spheres (Options C and D):**
   - The key here is understanding that a neutral conducting sphere will develop an induced charge distribution but not necessarily acquire a net charge of –Q as stated in Option B.
   - Since the nonconducting sphere has a positive charge +Q, it will induce negative charges on the side facing the nonconducting sphere and positive charges on the opposite side. This setup results in an overall attractive force between the two spheres due to the induced dipole moment.

Given this analysis:

- Option A is correct because an electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
- Option B is incorrect as the conducting sphere does not acquire a net charge of –Q; it rearranges its charges but remains neutral in total.
- Options C and D are related to the nature of the force between the spheres, which we can determine by considering the induced charges.

Since the positive charge on one sphere will attract the negative charges that have moved closer due to induction, there will be an electrostatic attraction between the two spheres. Therefore:

The correct answer is (C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",1.0,"Analyze the context of the question thoroughly, apply relevant knowledge or calculations, eliminate incorrect options based on the provided information, and select the most accurate answer.",11
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To determine the minimum positive number of days after which planets X, Y, and Z will be aligned with each other and the sun again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their orbital periods. The orbital periods are given as follows:

- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

The LCM of these numbers will give us the number of days after which all three planets will be in the same relative positions with respect to the sun.

First, we find the prime factorizations of each period:
- \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
- \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
- \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in these factorizations:
- The highest power of 2 is \(2^3\).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^3\).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\).

Thus, the LCM is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 = 8 \times 27 \times 25 \]

Now we perform the multiplication step-by-step:
\[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
\[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.

The correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,"Analyze the context of the question thoroughly, apply relevant knowledge or calculations, eliminate incorrect options based on the provided information, and select the most accurate answer.",11
