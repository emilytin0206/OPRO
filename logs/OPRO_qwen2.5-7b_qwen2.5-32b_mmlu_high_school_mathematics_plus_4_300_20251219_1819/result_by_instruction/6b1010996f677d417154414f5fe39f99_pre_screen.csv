"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

First, let's solve the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

### Step 1: Factorize the quadratic expression
The quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0 \) can be factored as:
\[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \]

This gives us the roots \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \).

### Step 2: Determine the intervals
The roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 3: Test each interval
We need to test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive.

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \):
  Choose \( x = -2 \).
  \[ (-2)^2 - 3(-2) - 4 = 4 + 6 - 4 = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \):
  Choose \( x = 0 \).
  \[ (0)^2 - 3(0) - 4 = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \):
  Choose \( x = 5 \).
  \[ (5)^2 - 3(5) - 4 = 25 - 15 - 4 = 6 > 0 \]

### Step 4: Combine the intervals
The expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \) is positive in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero, we exclude the points where the expression equals zero, which are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \).

### Conclusion
The domain of the function is:
\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved:

1. **Induced Electric Field in Conductors**: When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, the electric field from the nonconducting sphere will induce charges on the surface of the conducting sphere.

2. **Charge Induction and Distribution**: In a conductor, free electrons can move freely under the influence of an external electric field. When the nonconducting sphere with +Q is brought close to the neutral conducting sphere, the side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere will experience a higher electric field due to the presence of the positive charge. This causes the free electrons in the conductor to move away from this region towards the opposite side of the sphere.

3. **Charge Distribution**: As a result, an equal and opposite charge –Q will be induced on the side of the conducting sphere that is closest to the nonconducting sphere with +Q. The far side of the conducting sphere will have a net positive charge +Q due to the redistribution of electrons.

4. **Electrostatic Forces Between Spheres**: Since one sphere has a net positive charge and the other has an induced negative charge on its near surface, there will be an electrostatic attraction between them.

Given these points:

- (A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere: This is true because of the redistribution of charges.
- (B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q: This is not correct. The conducting sphere will have a net positive charge +Q on one side and an equal negative charge –Q on the other side, but overall it remains neutral due to the cancellation of these charges within the conductor.
- (C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction: This is true because of the opposite charges induced on their surfaces.
- (D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion: This is not correct based on the charge distribution described.

Therefore, the most precise answer from the given options is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",0.0,"Analyze the provided context or question meticulously, apply relevant theories or calculations as required, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer from those given based on the information presented.",13
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedents and the specific circumstances presented.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that determines the rights of parties without ordering any action or providing relief. The primary purpose is to resolve legal disputes before they lead to more serious consequences like criminal prosecution.

2. **Supreme Court Precedents on Declaratory Judgments**: In cases such as *Warth v. Seldin* (1975), the Supreme Court established criteria for when a declaratory judgment action can be brought, including that there must be an actual controversy and a genuine threat of enforcement.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: This suggests that the federal district court would dismiss the action due to interference with existing state prosecutions. While this is a valid concern, it does not directly address whether the law student has standing based on the criteria set by *Warth v. Seldin*.
   - **Option B**: This option states that a plaintiff can seek declaratory relief even if they are not threatened with prosecution under the same statute. However, this overlooks the need for an actual or imminent threat of enforcement as established in *Warth v. Seldin*.
   - **Option C**: This suggests that the law student has standing because his companions were arrested and he received prior warnings. This aligns well with the criteria set by *Warth v. Seldin*, which requires a genuine threat of enforcement against the plaintiff.
   - **Option D**: This option argues that declaratory relief would be premature due to speculative fears, but it does not consider the actual or imminent threat faced by the law student.

Given these considerations and applying the relevant legal principles:

**The correct answer is (C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly identifies that the law student has standing to seek declaratory relief based on the actual or imminent threat of enforcement against him, which meets the criteria set forth in *Warth v. Seldin*.",1.0,"Analyze the provided context or question meticulously, apply relevant theories or calculations as required, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer from those given based on the information presented.",13
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (work required to charge the capacitor),
- \( C \) is the capacitance of the capacitor,
- \( V \) is the potential difference across the capacitor.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]

\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-2} J \]

\[ U = 0.05 J \]

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the numbers without any remainder.

The given orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

\[ 2^3 = 8 \]
\[ 3^3 = 27 \]
\[ 5^2 = 25 \]

Multiplying these together:
\[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
\[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.
