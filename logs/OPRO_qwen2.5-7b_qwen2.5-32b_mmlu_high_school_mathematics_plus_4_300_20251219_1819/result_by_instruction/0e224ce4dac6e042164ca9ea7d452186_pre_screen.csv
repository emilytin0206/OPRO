"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To solve this problem, let's analyze each option based on the principles of electrostatics and the behavior of conductors in the presence of charges.

(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
- When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, an electric field is indeed induced within the conducting sphere. This is because the external electric field from the charged nonconducting sphere influences the free electrons in the conductor, causing them to rearrange and create an opposing electric field.

(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
- A neutral conducting sphere cannot acquire a net charge of -Q by itself. Instead, it will redistribute its charges such that the external influence is balanced out as much as possible. In this case, some electrons from the conductor would move towards the side closest to the charged nonconducting sphere, creating an induced negative charge on that side and a corresponding positive charge on the opposite side.

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
- Since one sphere has a net positive charge (+Q) and the other (after redistribution of charges) will have a net negative charge (-Q), there will be an attractive force between them due to the opposite charges attracting each other.

(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.
- This is incorrect because, as explained in option C, the forces involved are attractive rather than repulsive. Repulsion would occur if both spheres had like charges (both positive or both negative), which is not the case here.

Based on this analysis:

The correct answer is:
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",0.0,"Analyze the provided information carefully, apply relevant principles or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most accurate answer from those given based on the details presented.",20
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

First, let's solve for when the expression under the square root is greater than zero:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

We start by finding the roots of the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \]

So, the roots are:

\[ x = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -1 \]

Next, we analyze the sign of \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \) in the intervals determined by these roots: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

- For \( x < -1 \): Choose a test point, say \( x = -2 \):
  \[ (-2)^2 - 3(-2) - 4 = 4 + 6 - 4 = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose a test point, say \( x = 0 \):
  \[ 0^2 - 3(0) - 4 = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x > 4 \): Choose a test point, say \( x = 5 \):
  \[ 5^2 - 3(5) - 4 = 25 - 15 - 4 = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \) is positive in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero, we exclude the points where the quadratic equals zero, i.e., \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \). Therefore, the domain of the function is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a capacitor, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

Calculate step by step:
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-2} J \]
\[ U = 0.05 J \]

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider principles from constitutional law, specifically related to declaratory judgment actions and the balance between federal and state interests.

The key Supreme Court precedent here is **Younger v. Harris (1971)**, which established that federal courts should not issue injunctions against ongoing or threatened state criminal prosecutions unless there are exceptional circumstances. This principle of ""abstention"" applies to declaratory judgment actions as well, especially when the plaintiff seeks a ruling on the constitutionality of a statute.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) **Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**
- This is correct in part but not entirely accurate. The Younger doctrine applies to injunctive relief rather than declaratory judgments directly. However, it does influence whether a federal court should grant such relief.

(B) **No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.**
- This statement is incorrect. The Younger doctrine generally applies to situations where there is an actual or imminent threat of enforcement by state authorities.

(C) **No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**
- While this might seem plausible, it does not address the core issue of whether declaratory relief should be granted in light of ongoing or threatened state prosecutions.

(D) **Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.**
- This is incorrect as well. The Younger doctrine focuses more on the actuality and imminence of enforcement rather than mere speculation about future events.

Given these considerations, the most accurate answer is:

**(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**

This option correctly identifies that while a federal court can grant declaratory judgments in some circumstances, Younger v. Harris principles suggest that such relief should not be granted when it interferes with ongoing or threatened state criminal proceedings unless there are exceptional circumstances.",0.0,"Analyze the provided information carefully, apply relevant principles or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most accurate answer from those given based on the details presented.",20
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To determine the minimum positive number of days after which planets X, Y, and Z will be aligned with their sun in the exact same positions again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their orbital periods. The orbital periods are given as 360, 450, and 540 days.

First, let's factorize each number into its prime factors:
- \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
- \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
- \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in these factorizations:
- The highest power of 2 is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product step by step:
\[ 2^3 = 8 \]
\[ 3^3 = 27 \]
\[ 5^2 = 25 \]

Next, multiply these together:
\[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
\[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.

The correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,"Analyze the provided information carefully, apply relevant principles or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most accurate answer from those given based on the details presented.",20
