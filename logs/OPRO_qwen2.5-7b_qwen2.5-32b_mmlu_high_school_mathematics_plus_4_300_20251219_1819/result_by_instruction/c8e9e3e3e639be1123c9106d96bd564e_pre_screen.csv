"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done to charge the capacitor),
- \( C \) is the capacitance of the capacitor,
- \( V \) is the potential difference across the capacitor.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Now we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

First, calculate \( (100 V)^2 \):

\[ (100 V)^2 = 10000 V^2 \]

Now substitute this back into the equation:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 50 \times 10^{-3} J \]
\[ U = 0.05 J \]

Therefore, the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V is \( 0.05 J \).

The correct answer is (C) 0.05 J.",1.0,"Analyze the question thoroughly, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options systematically based on given information, and select the most precise answer from the provided choices.",9
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the given scenario.

1. **Nonconducting Sphere with +Q Charge**: This sphere has a net positive charge of +Q. When brought close to another object (in this case, a neutral conducting sphere), it will induce charges on the surface of the conducting sphere due to the electric field created by the nonconducting sphere.

2. **Neutral Conducting Sphere**: A conductor distributes its charge such that the electric field inside is zero. This means any external electric field will cause the free electrons in the conductor to move and rearrange themselves until they cancel out the external field within the conductor.

3. **Induced Charges on the Conducting Sphere**:
   - When a positive charge (+Q) approaches, it repels the free electrons in the conducting sphere towards one side of the sphere.
   - This leaves the other side with an excess of protons (positive charges), creating a net negative charge on that side.

4. **Electrostatic Forces Between the Spheres**:
   - The induced positive charge on the side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere will attract the +Q charge.
   - However, due to the overall neutrality and the distribution of charges, there is no net repulsion or attraction between the spheres as a whole.

Now let's evaluate each option:

(A) **An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
- This statement is true because when a nonconducting sphere with +Q charge approaches, it creates an external electric field that induces charges on the surface of the conducting sphere. However, this does not directly answer what happens between the spheres.

(B) **The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
- This statement is incorrect because while there are induced charges (positive and negative), they do not result in a net charge imbalance that would make the entire sphere have a net charge of -Q. The charges are distributed such that the overall charge remains neutral.

(C) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
- This statement could be true because the positive side of the conducting sphere (due to induced negative charges) will attract the +Q charge from the nonconducting sphere. However, this is not a complete answer as it does not address all aspects of the interaction.

(D) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
- This statement is incorrect because there is no net repulsive force between the two spheres due to their overall neutral charges and induced charge distribution.

Given these considerations, the most precise answer that directly addresses what happens in this scenario is:

(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.

This option correctly identifies a key aspect of the interaction without making assumptions about net charges or forces that are not fully supported by the principles of electrostatics.",0.0,"Analyze the question thoroughly, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options systematically based on given information, and select the most precise answer from the provided choices.",9
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedents and the specific circumstances presented.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that determines the rights or obligations between parties without ordering any action other than a declaration. The primary purpose is to resolve legal disputes before they lead to actual harm.

2. **Supreme Court Precedents on Declaratory Judgments**:
   - In *Warth v. Seldin* (1975), the Supreme Court established that for a declaratory judgment action, there must be an ""actual controversy"" between the parties.
   - In *Lesar v. Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co.* of Chicago (1982), the court emphasized that a plaintiff seeking a declaratory judgment must show a genuine threat of enforcement against them.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: This option suggests dismissing the action due to interference with existing state prosecutions, citing equity and comity. However, this is not directly relevant as there are no ongoing state prosecutions against the law student.
   - **Option B**: This option states that a federal plaintiff may seek declaratory judgment regardless of whether they are threatened by a state prosecution. While technically correct in general terms, it does not address the specific circumstances where an actual threat exists.
   - **Option C**: This option argues for denying dismissal based on the law student's companions being arrested and receiving warnings. It aligns with *Lesar v. Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co.*, which requires a genuine threat of enforcement against the plaintiff.
   - **Option D**: This suggests dismissing the action as premature because the law student’s fears are speculative. However, the arrest of his companions provides evidence that such fears may not be entirely speculative.

4. **Conclusion**:
Given the Supreme Court's emphasis on an actual controversy and a genuine threat of enforcement in *Lesar v. Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co.*, the most precise answer is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly identifies that the law student has a legitimate basis for seeking declaratory relief due to the demonstrated enforcement actions against his friends.",1.0,"Analyze the question thoroughly, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options systematically based on given information, and select the most precise answer from the provided choices.",9
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

So, we need to solve:

\[ (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \]

To find the intervals where this inequality holds true, we determine the roots of the equation \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

Next, we test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the inequality \( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \) is satisfied in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero, we exclude the points where the expression under the square root equals zero, which are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \). Therefore, the domain of the function is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the numbers without any remainder.

The given orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Identify the Highest Powers of Each Prime**:
   - For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

3. **Calculate LCM**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2
   \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     - \(2^3 = 8\)
     - \(3^3 = 27\)
     - \(5^2 = 25\)

4. **Multiply the Results**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 8 \times 27 \times 25
   \]
   - First, multiply 8 and 27:
     \[
     8 \times 27 = 216
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by 25:
     \[
     216 \times 25 = 5400
     \]

Thus, the least common multiple of 360, 450, and 540 is 5400.

### Conclusion:

The minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days. Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{B}
