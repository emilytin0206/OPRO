"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Setup**: We have two spheres - one nonconducting sphere with a net electric charge +Q and a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius.

2. **Induced Electric Field in Conductors**:
   - When a charged object is brought close to a conductor, an induced charge distribution occurs on the surface of the conductor. This happens because free electrons within the conductor can move under the influence of the external electric field created by the nonconducting sphere.
   
3. **Charge Induction and Neutral Conductor**:
   - The neutral conducting sphere will experience an electric field due to the presence of the charged nonconducting sphere. As a result, charges in the conducting sphere will rearrange themselves such that opposite charges are induced on the side closest to the nonconducting sphere (+Q), and like charges (positive) are induced on the far side.
   - This means the conducting sphere will not remain neutral; it will develop an induced charge distribution. However, the net charge of the conductor remains zero because the total positive charge on one side is exactly balanced by the negative charge on the other side.

4. **Electrostatic Forces Between Spheres**:
   - The nonconducting sphere with a net +Q charge and the conducting sphere will experience an electrostatic force due to their mutual electric fields.
   - Since opposite charges attract, there will be an attractive force between the two spheres.

Now let's evaluate each option:

(A) **An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
   - This is true because of the rearrangement of charges in the conductor under the influence of the external electric field from the nonconducting sphere.
   
(B) **The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
   - This statement is incorrect. The conducting sphere will have an induced charge distribution, but it will not result in a net charge of –Q; instead, there will be equal and opposite charges on either side that cancel out to zero when summed.

(C) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
   - This is true because the nonconducting sphere with +Q will attract the negative charges induced on the conducting sphere's surface closest to it.

(D) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
   - This statement is incorrect because there are no like charges (both positive or both negative) between the two spheres that would result in a repulsive force; instead, opposite charges attract.

Based on this analysis, the most accurate answer is:

**(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement rigorously, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options systematically, and select the most accurate answer based on the provided information.",18
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To analyze this problem rigorously, we need to consider the legal principles governing declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedents and the specific circumstances presented.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that determines the rights of parties without ordering any action or providing relief. The primary purpose is to resolve legal disputes before they lead to actual harm.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent on Declaratory Judgments**: In cases like *Warth v. Seldin* (1975), the Supreme Court established criteria for declaratory judgment actions, including:
   - A real and immediate controversy.
   - An actual case or controversy.
   - The party seeking relief must have standing.

3. **Applying the Criteria**:
   - **Real and Immediate Controversy**: The law student's companions were arrested, which suggests a real threat of enforcement against him as well.
   - **Actual Case or Controversy**: There is an ongoing dispute over the constitutionality of the criminal statutes in question.
   - **Standing**: The law student has standing because he faces a genuine threat of prosecution based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings.

4. **Evaluating Each Option**:
   - **Option (A)**: This option suggests that declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions, which is not necessarily true under the circumstances described. The Supreme Court has allowed declaratory judgments in cases where there is a genuine threat of enforcement.
   - **Option (B)**: This option states that a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute, which does not align with the specific circumstances and the need for a real and immediate controversy.
   - **Option (C)**: This option correctly identifies that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings. This meets the criteria for an actual case or controversy.
   - **Option (D)**: This option suggests that declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears are speculative, which is not accurate given the evidence of a real and immediate threat.

Based on this analysis, the most accurate answer is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly identifies that the law student has standing to seek declaratory relief due to the real and immediate threat of prosecution based on the actions of his companions and previous warnings from the police.",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement rigorously, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options systematically, and select the most accurate answer based on the provided information.",18
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

### Step 1: Factorize the quadratic expression
First, we factorize the quadratic equation:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

### Step 2: Determine where the factors are zero
Set each factor to zero to find the critical points:
\[ x - 4 = 0 \implies x = 4 \]
\[ x + 1 = 0 \implies x = -1 \]

These points divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 3: Test each interval
We need to determine where the product \((x-4)(x+1)\) is positive. We can test a point in each interval:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \), choose \( x = -2 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]

- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \), choose \( x = 0 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \), choose \( x = 5 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

### Step 4: Combine the results
The expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is satisfied in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 5: Consider the denominator
Since the function includes a square root in the denominator, we must ensure that the expression inside the square root is strictly positive. Therefore, we exclude the points where it equals zero:
\[ x = -1 \text{ and } x = 4 \]

Thus, the domain of \( f(x) \) is the union of the intervals where the expression is positive and non-zero:
\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

The correct answer is:

"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\( C \)) = 10 µF = \( 10 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F} \)
- Potential Difference (\( V \)) = 100 V

Now we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F}) \times (100 \, \text{V})^2 \]

First, calculate \( V^2 \):

\[ V^2 = (100)^2 = 10000 \, \text{V}^2 \]

Next, substitute this value back into the equation:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.1 \]
\[ U = 0.05 \, \text{J} \]

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:
