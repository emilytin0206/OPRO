"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the given scenario.

1. **Induced Electric Field (Option A):**
   - When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere. This is because the presence of the charged nonconducting sphere will cause charges in the conducting sphere to rearrange themselves due to electrostatic induction.

2. **Net Electric Charge on the Conducting Sphere (Option B):**
   - The key point here is that a conductor can distribute its charge such that the electric field inside it is zero when no external fields are present, except for induced fields from nearby charges. When the nonconducting sphere with +Q is brought close to the neutral conducting sphere, the free electrons in the conducting sphere will be displaced towards the side of the sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere. This leaves a net positive charge on the opposite side of the conducting sphere. However, this does not mean that the overall net electric charge of the conducting sphere becomes -Q; it simply means there is an induced polarization.

3. **Electrostatic Forces (Options C and D):**
   - The electrostatic force between two charged objects depends on their charges and the distance between them. Since one object has a positive charge (+Q) and the other, after induction, will have a net positive charge on its far side and a net negative charge on its near side, there will be an attractive force between the spheres due to the induced dipole moment.

Given these points:

- Option A is correct because an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere.
- Option B is incorrect as the overall net charge of the conducting sphere does not become -Q; it becomes polarized with a positive charge on one side and negative on the other.
- Options C and D are related to the nature of the force between the spheres, but since the conducting sphere will have an induced dipole moment due to the nearby nonconducting sphere, there will be an attractive electrostatic force.

Therefore, the most precise answer is:

**(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**",1.0,"Analyze the question and provided information thoroughly, apply relevant concepts or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer from those given.",13
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 0.005 J.",0.0,"Analyze the question and provided information thoroughly, apply relevant concepts or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer from those given.",13
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedent and the specific circumstances presented.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that determines the rights or obligations of parties without ordering any action other than a declaration. The primary purpose is to resolve legal disputes before they lead to actual harm.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent and Equitable Considerations**:
   - In *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club* (1976), the Supreme Court held that declaratory judgments are not appropriate when they would interfere with ongoing state prosecutions or administrative proceedings.
   - The principle of equity and comity also plays a role, meaning courts should avoid actions that might disrupt ongoing legal processes.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - (A) This option aligns well with the principles from *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club*. It suggests that the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and thus be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
   - (B) This is incorrect because it disregards the principle that a federal plaintiff may not seek declaratory judgment if they are already threatened by a state prosecution, as evidenced in *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club*.
   - (C) While this option acknowledges the arrest of companions and prior warnings, it does not address the core issue of whether the relief would interfere with ongoing prosecutions or administrative proceedings.
   - (D) This is incorrect because while the law student's fears might be speculative, they are based on concrete actions taken by the police against his friends. The Supreme Court has recognized that a declaratory judgment can be sought even if future harm is speculative but not entirely impossible.

4. **Conclusion**:
Given the principles from *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club* and the need to avoid interfering with ongoing state prosecutions, the most precise answer is:

**(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**

This option correctly identifies that the federal district court should dismiss the action due to potential interference with ongoing legal proceedings.",0.0,"Analyze the question and provided information thoroughly, apply relevant concepts or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer from those given.",13
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, determine where this product is greater than zero. The roots of the equation are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero and we have already ensured that it is positive in these intervals, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.
