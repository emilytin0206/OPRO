"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a capacitor, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

Calculate step by step:
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-2} J \]
\[ U = 0.05 J \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) 0.05 J",1.0,"Analyze each option carefully, eliminate incorrect answers, and select the most accurate response based on the given information.",2
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"Let's analyze each option carefully:

(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
- When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, the charges in the conducting sphere will rearrange due to the influence of the external electric field. This results in an induced electric field within the conducting sphere.

(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
- A conducting sphere cannot have a net charge because any excess charge on a conductor distributes itself on its surface, and the interior remains charge-free. Therefore, the neutral conducting sphere will not acquire a net charge of -Q; instead, it will redistribute charges to create an induced field.

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
- Since one sphere has a positive charge (+Q) and the other is initially neutral but will develop an induced negative charge on its side facing the +Q sphere, there will be an attractive force between them due to opposite charges.

(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.
- This would only occur if both spheres had like charges (both positive or both negative), which is not the case here. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

Based on the analysis:

The most accurate response is:
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",0.0,"Analyze each option carefully, eliminate incorrect answers, and select the most accurate response based on the given information.",2
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that the expression under the square root is positive and that the denominator is not zero. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Identify where the denominator is defined:**
   The denominator of the function is \( \sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 4} \). For the square root to be defined, the expression inside it must be greater than zero (since the square root of a non-positive number would not yield a real value in this context).

2. **Solve the inequality:**
   We need to solve \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \). First, factorize the quadratic expression:
   \[
   x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1)
   \]
   So, we need to find where \( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \).

3. **Determine the intervals:**
   The roots of the equation \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \) are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

   We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
   - For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \), choose \( x = -2 \):
     \[
     (x - 4)(x + 1) = (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0
     \]
   - For \( x \in (-1, 4) \), choose \( x = 0 \):
     \[
     (x - 4)(x + 1) = (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0
     \]
   - For \( x \in (4, \infty) \), choose \( x = 5 \):
     \[
     (x - 4)(x + 1) = (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0
     \]

   Therefore, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

4. **Combine with the domain of the square root:**
   Since the denominator cannot be zero and must be positive, we exclude the points where the expression equals zero, which are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \). Thus, the domain is:
   \[
   (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty)
   \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"The correct answer is (C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.

Explanation:
- **Option A** is incorrect. The Supreme Court's decision in *Los Angeles v. Lyons* (1988) established that declaratory judgments should not be dismissed merely because they might interfere with ongoing state prosecutions. The court emphasized that such dismissals would undermine the purpose of declaratory judgment actions.
  
- **Option B** is also incorrect. While a federal plaintiff may seek declaratory relief, this option does not address the specific circumstances presented in the scenario, which include a genuine threat to the law student based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings.

- **Option D** is incorrect because it incorrectly states that the law student's fears are speculative. The fact that his friends were arrested and he received warnings provides a concrete basis for believing he faces a real risk of enforcement under these statutes.

- **Option C** correctly identifies that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, which is sufficient to justify seeking declaratory relief in federal court. This option aligns with Supreme Court precedent, such as *Los Angeles v. Lyons* and other cases where courts have recognized the legitimacy of seeking declaratory judgments when there is a real and immediate threat.

Therefore, based on the given information and Supreme Court precedent, the federal district court will not dismiss the declaratory judgment action filed by the law student.",1.0,"Analyze each option carefully, eliminate incorrect answers, and select the most accurate response based on the given information.",2
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To determine the minimum positive number of days after which planets X, Y, and Z will be aligned with each other again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their orbital periods. The orbital periods are given as follows:

- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

The LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of each of these numbers.

First, we find the prime factorization of each period:
- \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
- \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
- \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in these factorizations:
- The highest power of 2 is \(2^3\).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^3\).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 = 8 \times 27 \times 25 \]

Calculating step-by-step:
\[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
\[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.

The correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,"Analyze each option carefully, eliminate incorrect answers, and select the most accurate response based on the given information.",2
