"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's break down the scenario and apply relevant principles from electrostatics.

### Scenario Analysis:
- We have a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge \(+Q\).
- This nonconducting sphere is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Induced Charges in Conductors**: When a charged object (in this case, the nonconducting sphere) approaches a conductor, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. The side of the conductor closest to the charge will develop an induced negative charge, and the far side will develop an induced positive charge.
2. **Electrostatic Forces**: Electrostatic forces between charged objects follow Coulomb's law, which states that like charges repel each other and opposite charges attract.

### Applying the Concepts:
- When the nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge \(+Q\) is brought close to the neutral conducting sphere, the side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere will develop an induced negative charge. This is because the positive charge on the nonconducting sphere repels electrons in the conductor, causing them to move towards the far side.
- The far side of the conducting sphere will thus have a net positive charge due to the redistribution of charges.

### Evaluating the Options:
(A) **An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
   - This is true because the presence of the nonconducting charged sphere creates an external electric field, which induces charges on the surface of the conductor.
   
(B) **The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
   - This is incorrect because the total charge in a closed system must be conserved. The neutral conducting sphere cannot acquire a net charge of \(-Q\); it can only redistribute its charges.

(C) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
   - This is true because the induced negative charge on the side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere will attract the positive charge of the nonconducting sphere, leading to an attractive force between them.
   
(D) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
   - This is incorrect because there are no like charges (both positive or both negative) that would result in a repulsive force.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and application of electrostatic principles, the most precise answer is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",0.0,"Analyze the question in detail, apply necessary theories or calculations, eliminate incorrect options based on given information, and select the most precise answer from those provided.",9
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To analyze this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedent and the specific circumstances presented.

### Analysis:

1. **Nature of Declaratory Judgment Action**: A declaratory judgment is a lawsuit brought by one party seeking a court's determination on the rights, status, or legal relations between parties without any actual controversy over which there are adverse legal interests. The purpose is to clarify the legal situation before taking further action.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent and Declaratory Judgments**: In *Warth v. Seldin* (1975), the Supreme Court established criteria for a justiciable case or controversy, which includes:
   - A real and immediate threat of enforcement against the plaintiff.
   - The existence of a genuine legal question that can be resolved by the court.

3. **Application to the Case**:
   - **Option (A)**: This option suggests dismissing the action because it would interfere with existing state prosecutions, citing equity and comity. However, this is not directly relevant as the law student has already been warned but not yet prosecuted.
   - **Option (B)**: This option states that a federal plaintiff may seek declaratory judgment even if not threatened by a state prosecution on the statute. While technically correct in general terms, it does not address the specific circumstances of the case.
   - **Option (C)**: This option argues for denying dismissal based on the law student's companions being arrested and prior warnings. The key here is whether these events create a ""real and immediate"" threat to the law student.
   - **Option (D)**: This suggests dismissing the action as premature because the law student’s fears are speculative.

### Key Considerations:
- The Supreme Court in *Warth v. Seldin* emphasized that there must be a real, imminent threat of enforcement for declaratory relief to be granted.
- The fact that the companions were arrested and warnings were given does create a plausible scenario where the law student could face similar charges.

### Conclusion:

Given these considerations, **Option (C)** is the most precise answer. It correctly identifies that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on the arrest of his companions and prior warnings from the police. This meets the criteria for a justiciable case or controversy as established by Supreme Court precedent.

**Final Answer: (C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**",1.0,"Analyze the question in detail, apply necessary theories or calculations, eliminate incorrect options based on given information, and select the most precise answer from those provided.",9
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the numerator and the denominator are defined. Specifically, for the square root in the denominator, the expression inside must be positive because the square root of a negative number is not real, and division by zero is undefined.

Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. **Identify where the denominator is defined:**
   The denominator is \(\sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 4}\). For the expression under the square root to be defined (and positive), we need:
   \[
   x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0
   \]

2. **Solve the inequality \(x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0\):**
   First, solve the equation \(x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0\) to find the critical points.
   \[
   x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) = 0
   \]
   So, the roots are:
   \[
   x = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -1
   \]

3. **Determine the intervals where \(x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0\):**
   The critical points divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -1)\), \((-1, 4)\), and \((4, \infty)\). We test a point in each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

   - For \(x < -1\): Choose \(x = -2\)
     \[
     (-2)^2 - 3(-2) - 4 = 4 + 6 - 4 = 6 > 0
     \]
   - For \(-1 < x < 4\): Choose \(x = 0\)
     \[
     (0)^2 - 3(0) - 4 = -4 < 0
     \]
   - For \(x > 4\): Choose \(x = 5\)
     \[
     (5)^2 - 3(5) - 4 = 25 - 15 - 4 = 6 > 0
     \]

   Therefore, the inequality \(x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0\) holds in the intervals:
   \[
   (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty)
   \]

4. **Combine with the domain of the function:**
   The function is defined where the denominator is positive and non-zero. Since we have already determined that \(x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0\) in the intervals \((-\infty, -1)\) and \((4, \infty)\), these are the valid domains.

Thus, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:
\[
(-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty)
\]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers without a remainder.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Identify the Highest Powers of Each Prime**:
   - For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

3. **Calculate LCM**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2
   \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     - \(2^3 = 8\)
     - \(3^3 = 27\)
     - \(5^2 = 25\)

4. **Multiply the Results**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 8 \times 27 \times 25
   \]
   - First, multiply 8 and 27:
     \[
     8 \times 27 = 216
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by 25:
     \[
     216 \times 25 = 5400
     \]

Thus, the least common multiple of 360, 450, and 540 is 5400.

### Conclusion:

The minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,"Analyze the question in detail, apply necessary theories or calculations, eliminate incorrect options based on given information, and select the most precise answer from those provided.",9
