"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

### Step 1: Factorize the quadratic expression
The quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0 \) can be factored as:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

### Step 2: Determine where the factors are zero
Set each factor equal to zero to find the critical points:
\[ x - 4 = 0 \implies x = 4 \]
\[ x + 1 = 0 \implies x = -1 \]

These points divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 3: Test each interval
We need to determine where the product \((x-4)(x+1)\) is positive. We can test a point in each interval:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \), choose \( x = -2 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]

- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \), choose \( x = 0 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \), choose \( x = 5 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

### Step 4: Combine the results
The expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is satisfied in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 5: Consider the denominator
Since the function has a square root in the denominator, we must ensure that the expression inside the square root is strictly positive. Therefore, we exclude the points where it equals zero:
\[ x = -1 \text{ and } x = 4 \]

Thus, the domain of \( f(x) \) is the union of the intervals where the expression under the square root is positive:
\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider relevant legal principles, particularly those related to declaratory judgment actions and the standards for obtaining such relief. Let’s analyze each option in detail:

(A) **Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**
- This option suggests that a federal court should dismiss the action because it might interfere with ongoing state proceedings. However, this reasoning is more applicable to cases where there's an actual or imminent threat of prosecution, which isn't necessarily present here.

(B) **No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.**
- This option is incorrect as it misinterprets the legal standards for seeking declaratory relief. The availability of declaratory relief does not depend solely on whether there's an immediate threat or not.

(C) **No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**
- This option is plausible. Under the Declaratory Judgment Act (28 U.S.C. § 2201), a federal court may grant declaratory relief if there is an actual controversy between parties with opposing legal interests. The law student can argue that he faces a genuine threat of enforcement based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings.

(D) **Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.**
- This option suggests dismissing the action due to the speculative nature of the law student’s fears. However, the Supreme Court has recognized that declaratory judgments can be granted even if there is no immediate threat but where there is a genuine and imminent risk.

Given these considerations, the most accurate answer is:

**C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option aligns with legal principles that allow for declaratory relief when there's an actual or imminent threat of enforcement, even if it isn't directly against the plaintiff seeking the judgment.",0.0,"Analyze the question deeply, use relevant theories or calculations, eliminate incorrect options based on given information, and choose the most accurate answer.",13
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

Calculate step by step:
1. Calculate \( V^2 \):
   \[ V^2 = (100 V)^2 = 10000 V^2 \]
2. Multiply the capacitance by \( V^2 \):
   \[ C \times V^2 = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \times 10000 V^2 = 10 \times 10^{-2} J = 0.1 J \]
3. Finally, multiply by \( \frac{1}{2} \):
   \[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.1 J = 0.05 J \]

Therefore, the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V is:

\[ \boxed{0.05 J} \]

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's break down the scenario and apply relevant principles from electrostatics.

### Given:
- A nonconducting sphere with a net electric charge \( +Q \).
- A neutral conducting sphere of the same radius as the nonconducting sphere.
- The nonconducting sphere is brought close to the conducting sphere.

### Analysis:

1. **Electric Field Induction in Conductors:**
   - When a charged object (in this case, the nonconducting sphere with charge \( +Q \)) approaches a conductor, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. The induced charges rearrange themselves such that they create an electric field that opposes the external field due to the nonconducting sphere.

2. **Charge Distribution in Conductors:**
   - In a conductor, free electrons are mobile and can move freely within the material.
   - When a charged object is brought close to a conductor, these free electrons will be displaced by the external electric field created by the charge on the nonconducting sphere. This displacement results in an induced charge distribution on the surface of the conducting sphere.

3. **Induced Charges:**
   - The side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere with \( +Q \) will develop a negative charge (induced by the positive charge), and the opposite side will develop a positive charge.
   - This induced charge distribution ensures that the net electric field inside the conductor is zero, as required for electrostatic equilibrium.

4. **Electrostatic Forces:**
   - The nonconducting sphere with \( +Q \) will experience an attractive force due to the negative charges on the side of the conducting sphere closest to it.
   - Conversely, the induced positive charge on the far side of the conducting sphere will also exert a repulsive force but this is generally much weaker compared to the attractive forces.

### Evaluating the Options:

- **(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
  - This statement is incorrect because in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside a conductor must be zero.
  
- **(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
  - This statement is also incorrect. While there will be an induced negative charge on one side and positive charge on the other side, these charges are not equal in magnitude to \( +Q \). They are induced charges that balance out the external field within the conductor.

- **(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
  - This statement is correct. The nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge \( +Q \) will attract the negative charges on the side of the conducting sphere closest to it, resulting in an attractive force between the two spheres.

- **(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
  - This statement is incorrect because the induced charges on the conducting sphere will create a net attractive force due to the opposite charge distribution.

### Conclusion:
The most accurate answer based on the analysis and principles of electrostatics is:

**(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**",0.0,"Analyze the question deeply, use relevant theories or calculations, eliminate incorrect options based on given information, and choose the most accurate answer.",13
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers without any remainder.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Identify the Highest Powers of Each Prime**:
   - For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

3. **Calculate LCM**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2
   \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     - \(2^3 = 8\)
     - \(3^3 = 27\)
     - \(5^2 = 25\)

4. **Multiply the Results**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 8 \times 27 \times 25
   \]
   - First, multiply 8 and 27:
     \[
     8 \times 27 = 216
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by 25:
     \[
     216 \times 25 = 5400
     \]

Thus, the least common multiple of 360, 450, and 540 is 5400.

### Conclusion:

The minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,"Analyze the question deeply, use relevant theories or calculations, eliminate incorrect options based on given information, and choose the most accurate answer.",13
