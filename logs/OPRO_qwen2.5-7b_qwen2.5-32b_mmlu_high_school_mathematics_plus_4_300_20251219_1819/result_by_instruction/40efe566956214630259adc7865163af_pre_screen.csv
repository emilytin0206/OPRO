"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Setup**: We have two spheres - one nonconducting sphere with a net electric charge +Q and a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius.

2. **Induced Electric Field in Conductors**:
   - When a charged object is brought close to a conductor, an induced charge distribution occurs on the surface of the conductor. This happens because free electrons within the conductor can move around due to their mobility.
   - The nonconducting sphere with +Q will induce a negative charge on one side and a positive charge on the other side of the conducting sphere.

3. **Charge Induction**:
   - In the neutral conducting sphere, the presence of the charged nonconducting sphere will cause an equal but opposite induced charge to appear on the side closest to the nonconducting sphere.
   - This means that the side of the conducting sphere nearest to the +Q charge will develop a net negative charge (let's call it –q), and the far side will have a corresponding positive charge (+q) to maintain overall neutrality.

4. **Electrostatic Forces**:
   - The induced charges on the conducting sphere will create an electric field around them.
   - Since the nonconducting sphere has a net +Q charge, there will be an attractive force between it and the negative side of the conducting sphere (–q).
   - This attraction is due to the opposite charges.

5. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere**: This statement is true because the free electrons in the conductor will rearrange themselves, creating an induced charge distribution.
   - **(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q**: This is incorrect. While there will be a localized negative charge on one side due to induction, the overall charge of the conducting sphere remains zero because charges are free to move and distribute evenly across the conductor's surface.
   - **(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction**: This statement is true based on the induced charges described. The nonconducting sphere with +Q will attract the negative side (–q) of the conducting sphere.
   - **(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion**: This is incorrect because opposite charges attract, not repel.

Given this analysis, the most precise answer from the provided options is:

**(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement meticulously, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on given information, and select the most precise answer from those provided.",12
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedents and the specific circumstances presented.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that determines the rights or obligations of parties without ordering any action other than the declaration itself. The primary purpose is to resolve legal disputes before they lead to actual harm, providing clarity on the application of laws.

2. **Supreme Court Precedents and Declaratory Judgments**: In cases like *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club* (1970), the Supreme Court established that a declaratory judgment action can be brought even if there is no immediate threat of prosecution, as long as the plaintiff can show a ""real and immediate"" controversy.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: This option suggests dismissing the case due to interference with existing state prosecutions. However, this reasoning typically applies when the declaratory judgment would directly interfere with ongoing or imminent enforcement actions.
   - **Option B**: This is incorrect because it overlooks the need for a genuine threat of enforcement against the plaintiff.
   - **Option C**: This option correctly identifies that the law student can seek declaratory relief if he can show a ""real and immediate"" threat. The arrest of his companions and prior warnings provide such a threat, making this a plausible basis for seeking declaratory relief.
   - **Option D**: While it mentions the speculative nature of future arrests, it incorrectly dismisses the possibility that the law student's fears are not sufficiently real or immediate based on the given facts.

4. **Conclusion Based on Supreme Court Precedents and Given Facts**:
Given the arrest of his companions and prior warnings from the police, the law student can demonstrate a ""real and immediate"" threat to his rights under the criminal statutes in question. Therefore, he is entitled to seek declaratory relief.

The most precise answer is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**",1.0,"Analyze the problem statement meticulously, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on given information, and select the most precise answer from those provided.",12
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, we factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

So, the inequality becomes:

\[ (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \]

To solve this inequality, we find the roots of the equation \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the inequality \( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \) holds for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Next, we need to ensure that the denominator is not zero. The expression under the square root must be strictly greater than zero, so there are no additional restrictions from this part.

Therefore, combining these results, the domain of \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:
