"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

### Step 1: Factorize the quadratic expression
First, we factorize the quadratic equation:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

### Step 2: Determine where the factors are zero
Set each factor to zero and solve for \( x \):
\[ x - 4 = 0 \implies x = 4 \]
\[ x + 1 = 0 \implies x = -1 \]

These points, \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \), divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 3: Test each interval
We need to determine where the product \((x-4)(x+1)\) is positive. We can test a point in each interval:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \), choose \( x = -2 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]

- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \), choose \( x = 0 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \), choose \( x = 5 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

### Step 4: Combine the results
The expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \) is positive in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 5: Ensure the denominator is not zero
Since we need the square root to be defined and non-zero, we exclude the points where the expression equals zero:
\[ x = -1 \text{ and } x = 4 \]

Thus, the domain of \( f(x) \) is all real numbers in the intervals where the expression inside the square root is positive, excluding the points that make it zero.

### Final Answer
The correct answer is:
\[

"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Next, multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]

Simplify the expression:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.1 \]
\[ U = 0.05 \, \text{J} \]

Therefore, the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V is:

\(\boxed{0.05 \, \text{J}}\)

So, the correct answer is (C) 0.05 J.",1.0,"Analyze the problem statement in detail, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on logical reasoning, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",12
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Setup**: We have two spheres - one nonconducting sphere with a net electric charge +Q and a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius.

2. **Electric Field Induction in Conductors**:
   - When a charged object is brought close to a conductor, an induced charge distribution occurs on the surface of the conductor. This happens because free electrons within the conductor can move under the influence of the external electric field.
   
3. **Induced Charges and Electric Fields**:
   - The nonconducting sphere with +Q will create an electric field around it. When this charged sphere is brought close to the neutral conducting sphere, the side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere will experience a higher electric field strength due to the presence of the charge +Q.
   - As a result, free electrons in the conducting sphere will be repelled towards the opposite (farther) side of the sphere. This leaves an excess positive charge on the near side and an equal negative charge on the far side.

4. **Net Charge Consideration**:
   - The problem states that the conducting sphere is initially neutral. Therefore, it does not have a net electric charge before interaction with the nonconducting charged sphere.
   - After induction, the conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q (negative) on its near side and +Q (positive) on its far side, but these charges are equal in magnitude.

5. **Electrostatic Forces**:
   - The electrostatic force between two objects depends on their charges and the distance between them.
   - Since the nonconducting sphere has a net charge of +Q and the conducting sphere will have an induced negative charge –Q (on its near side), there will be an attractive force between these two regions.

Now, let's evaluate each option:

(A) **An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere**:
   - This is true. The electric field from the nonconducting sphere induces a charge distribution on the surface of the conducting sphere.
   
(B) **The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q**:
   - While there will be an induced negative charge on one side, this does not mean the entire conducting sphere has a net charge. The charges are distributed such that the overall net charge remains zero.

(C) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction**:
   - This is true because the positive charge of the nonconducting sphere attracts the negative charge induced on the near side of the conducting sphere.
   
(D) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion**:
   - This is false. The charges are opposite, leading to an attractive force.

Based on this analysis and logical reasoning:

- Option (A) is true but not the most accurate answer in terms of net charge distribution.
- Option (B) is incorrect as it misinterprets the net charge state.
- Option (C) correctly identifies the electrostatic attraction between the spheres.
- Option (D) is false.

Therefore, the correct and most accurate answer is:

**(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement in detail, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on logical reasoning, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",12
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To analyze this problem statement, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedent. The key points to examine include:

1. **Nature of Declaratory Judgment**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that determines the rights and obligations between parties without ordering any specific action or awarding damages.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent on Declaratory Judgments**: In cases like *Warth v. Seldin* (1975), the Supreme Court established criteria for when declaratory judgments can be granted, including a ""real and immediate"" threat of enforcement against the plaintiff.

3. **Equity and Comity**: Courts generally avoid issuing declarations that might interfere with ongoing state prosecutions or administrative proceedings to maintain comity between federal and state courts.

Now let's analyze each option:

(A) **Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**
- This option suggests a dismissal based on interference with state prosecutions. However, the law student is not currently facing prosecution; his companions are. The threat to him is speculative at this point.

(B) **No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.**
- This option is incorrect as it does not consider the ""real and immediate"" threat requirement established by *Warth v. Seldin*.

(C) **No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**
- This option seems plausible at first glance but needs to be scrutinized further. While there is evidence of past enforcement actions, it's not clear if these actions are directly applicable or if they create an immediate and real threat.

(D) **Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.**
- This option aligns with *Warth v. Seldin* criteria, which require that the plaintiff show a ""real and immediate"" threat of enforcement against them.

Given these considerations, the most accurate answer is:

**D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.**

This conclusion is based on the Supreme Court precedent that requires a plaintiff to show a ""real and immediate"" threat before a federal court will grant declaratory relief. The law student’s situation does not meet this standard, as he has not been directly threatened or prosecuted under the statutes in question.",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement in detail, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on logical reasoning, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",12
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers without any remainder.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Identify the Highest Powers of Each Prime**:
   - For \(2\): The highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\): The highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\): The highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

3. **Calculate the LCM**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2
   \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     - \(2^3 = 8\)
     - \(3^3 = 27\)
     - \(5^2 = 25\)

4. **Multiply the Results**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 8 \times 27 \times 25
   \]
   - First, multiply 8 and 27:
     \[
     8 \times 27 = 216
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by 25:
     \[
     216 \times 25 = 5400
     \]

Thus, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.
