"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"The correct answer is (C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.

Explanation:

This question involves understanding the principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions in federal court, particularly under the Declaratory Judgment Act. The key points to consider are:

1. **Genuine Threat of Enforcement**: For a declaratory judgment action to be granted, there must be a genuine threat or likelihood that the plaintiff will face enforcement of the statute in question. In this case, the law student's companions were arrested for criminal trespass and loitering after being warned by police, which provides evidence of a genuine threat.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent**: The Supreme Court has established that declaratory relief can be granted when there is an actual controversy between parties. This means that if the plaintiff can show a real and immediate risk of enforcement against them, they are entitled to seek a declaration from the court regarding the constitutionality of the statute.

3. **Equity and Comity**: While equity and comity considerations might play a role in some cases, they do not override the requirement for an actual controversy or genuine threat of enforcement. The Supreme Court has been more lenient in allowing declaratory judgments when there is a clear and present danger to the plaintiff's rights.

4. **Prematurity of Action**: Prematurity would be a reason to dismiss if the law student had no immediate risk of being arrested, but here, the prior warnings and arrest of his companions establish that he faces an imminent threat.

Therefore, based on these principles and Supreme Court precedent, the federal district court will not dismiss the declaratory judgment action because the law student can demonstrate a genuine threat of enforcement against him.",1.0,"Analyze the problem statement carefully, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, and select the most accurate answer from the provided options based on the information given.",8
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work required to charge the capacitor),
- \( C \) is the capacitance of the capacitor,
- \( V \) is the potential difference across the capacitor.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Now we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

First, calculate \( (100 V)^2 \):

\[ (100 V)^2 = 10000 V^2 \]

Now substitute this back into the equation:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times 10000 V^2 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 \times 10^{-3} J \]
\[ U = 50 \times 10^{-3} J \]
\[ U = 0.05 J \]

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the scenario described.

1. **Nonconducting Sphere with +Q Charge**: This sphere has a net positive charge of +Q. When brought close to another object (in this case, a neutral conducting sphere), it will induce charges on the surface of the conducting sphere due to the electric field created by the nonconducting sphere.

2. **Neutral Conducting Sphere**: A conductor's property is that its free electrons can move freely throughout the material. In response to an external electric field (such as from the +Q charge), these free electrons will rearrange themselves on the surface of the conducting sphere, creating a distribution of charges that counteract the external field.

3. **Induced Charges**: When the nonconducting sphere with +Q is brought close to the neutral conducting sphere, the side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere will develop an induced negative charge (-Q) because the free electrons in the conductor are repelled by the positive charge and move towards the far side. The far side of the conducting sphere will thus have a net positive charge (+Q).

4. **Electrostatic Forces**: Since one sphere has a +Q charge and the other has an induced -Q charge on its near surface, there will be an electrostatic attraction between them.

Based on this analysis:

- (A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere: This is true because the free electrons in the conductor will rearrange themselves due to the external electric field.
- (B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q: This is not accurate. The conducting sphere will have an induced -Q charge on its near surface, but it won't have a net charge overall since charges are free to move and can be redistributed until equilibrium is reached.
- (C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction: This is true due to the opposite charges that develop between them.
- (D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion: This is not accurate because the induced charges on the conducting sphere are of opposite sign to the charge on the nonconducting sphere, leading to an attractive force.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the information given and the principles of electrostatics is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement carefully, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, and select the most accurate answer from the provided options based on the information given.",8
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

So, we need to solve:

\[ (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \]

To find the intervals where this inequality holds true, we determine the roots of the equation \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

Next, we test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

From this analysis, we see that the inequality \( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \) is satisfied in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

Therefore, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:
