"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved:

1. **Induced Electric Field in Conductors**: When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, the electric field from the nonconducting sphere will induce charges on the surface of the conducting sphere.

2. **Charge Induction and Distribution**: In a conductor, free electrons can move freely under the influence of an external electric field. When the nonconducting sphere with +Q is brought close to the neutral conducting sphere, the side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere will experience a higher electric field due to the presence of the positive charge. This causes the free electrons in the conductor to move away from this region towards the opposite side of the sphere.

3. **Charge Distribution**: As a result, an equal and opposite charge –Q will be induced on the side of the conducting sphere that is closest to the nonconducting sphere with +Q. The far side of the conducting sphere will have a net positive charge +Q due to the redistribution of electrons.

4. **Electrostatic Forces Between Spheres**: Since one sphere has a net positive charge and the other has an induced negative charge on its near surface, there will be an electrostatic attraction between them.

Now let's evaluate each option:

(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
- This is true because the electric field from the nonconducting sphere induces charges in the conductor. However, this does not directly answer what happens to the overall charge distribution or interaction between the spheres.

(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
- This is incorrect because while there is an induced negative charge on one side, the total charge of the conducting sphere remains zero due to the redistribution of charges. The net charge does not change from neutral.

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
- This is correct based on the principle that opposite charges attract each other.

(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.
- This is incorrect because there are no like charges (both positive or both negative) between the spheres to cause repulsion. Instead, there is a net attractive force due to the induced charge distribution.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the analysis and principles of electrostatics is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",0.0,"Analyze the provided context or question meticulously, apply relevant theories or calculations as required, discern and eliminate incorrect options based on given information, and select the most accurate answer from those available.",5
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done to charge the capacitor),
- \( C \) is the capacitance of the capacitor,
- \( V \) is the potential difference across the capacitor.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]

\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-2} J \]

\[ U = 0.05 J \]

"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, determine where this product is greater than zero. The roots of the equation are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero and we have already ensured that it is non-zero in these intervals, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the principles governing declaratory judgment actions under federal law, particularly as they relate to the Declaratory Judgment Act (DJA) and Supreme Court precedents.

The Declaratory Judgment Act allows a person ""to have determined any actual controversy"" that is legally capable of determination. However, there are limitations on when such an action can be brought, especially in relation to pending or threatened state prosecutions.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
- This is a plausible argument. The Supreme Court has held that declaratory judgments should not be used to interfere with ongoing state proceedings or prosecutions. However, this option does not fully consider the law student's situation.

(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
- This statement is generally true but does not address the specific circumstances of the case where there are existing threats or prosecutions against others.

(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
- This option correctly identifies that the law student has shown a concrete and imminent threat to his own rights. The Supreme Court's decision in *Warth v. Seldin* (1975) established that a declaratory judgment can be granted if there is a ""real and immediate"" threat of enforcement against the plaintiff.

(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.
- This option suggests that the law student’s fears are too speculative. However, given the concrete actions taken by the police (arresting companions and issuing warnings), this argument is less compelling.

Given these considerations, the most accurate answer is:

(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.

This option correctly applies Supreme Court precedent to the specific facts presented in the scenario.",0.0,"Analyze the provided context or question meticulously, apply relevant theories or calculations as required, discern and eliminate incorrect options based on given information, and select the most accurate answer from those available.",5
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the numbers without any remainder.

The given orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

To find the LCM, we can use their prime factorizations:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **LCM Calculation**:
   The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers.
   - For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Therefore, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 = 8 \times 27 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Thus, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is **5400**.

The correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,"Analyze the provided context or question meticulously, apply relevant theories or calculations as required, discern and eliminate incorrect options based on given information, and select the most accurate answer from those available.",5
