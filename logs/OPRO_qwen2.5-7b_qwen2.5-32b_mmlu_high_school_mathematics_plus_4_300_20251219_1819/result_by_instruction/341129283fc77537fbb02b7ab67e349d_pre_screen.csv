"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the scenario described.

1. **Nonconducting Sphere with +Q Charge**: This sphere has a net positive charge of +Q. When brought close to another object (in this case, a neutral conducting sphere), it will induce charges on the surface of the conducting sphere due to the electric field created by the nonconducting sphere.

2. **Conducting Sphere Initially Neutral**: A conducting sphere initially has no net charge. However, when placed in an electric field, free electrons within the conductor can move and rearrange themselves to counteract the external field as much as possible.

3. **Induced Charges on Conducting Sphere**:
   - When a positive charge is brought close to one side of a neutral conducting sphere, the electrons in the conductor will be repelled by the positive charge and move towards the opposite side.
   - This movement of charges results in an induced negative charge on the side closest to the nonconducting sphere with +Q and an induced positive charge on the far side.

4. **Electrostatic Forces**:
   - The induced negative charge on the side of the conducting sphere nearest the nonconducting sphere will experience a repulsive force from the +Q charge.
   - However, the overall effect is that there will be an attractive electrostatic force between the two spheres due to the redistribution of charges.

Now let's evaluate each option:

(A) **An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
- This statement is true because when a nonconducting sphere with +Q charge approaches a neutral conducting sphere, it induces a rearrangement of charges in the conductor, creating an internal electric field that helps to distribute the charges.

(B) **The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
- This is incorrect because while there will be an induced negative charge on one side and a positive charge on the other side, these charges are not equal in magnitude (the total charge remains zero due to conservation of charge).

(C) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
- This statement is true based on the principle that opposite charges attract each other. The induced negative charge on the conducting sphere will be attracted to the positive charge +Q.

(D) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
- This is incorrect because there is no net charge on either sphere, and the forces between them are due to the redistribution of charges rather than a direct repulsion.

Therefore, based on the analysis:

**The most accurate answer is (C): The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**",1.0,"Analyze the context of the question meticulously, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on logical reasoning, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",11
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, determine where this product is greater than zero. The roots of the equation are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero and we have already ensured that it is positive in these intervals, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedents and the specific circumstances presented.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that clarifies or declares one's rights under existing laws without ordering any action. The primary purpose is to provide clarity on the legal status of parties involved.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent**: In cases such as *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club* (1970), the Supreme Court established that declaratory judgments can be granted even if there's no immediate threat of prosecution, provided there is a genuine and substantial controversy. However, in *United States v. W.T. Grant Co.* (1965), the Court emphasized that courts should not issue declarations that would interfere with ongoing state prosecutions.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: This option suggests dismissing the action due to interference with existing state prosecutions and concerns over equity and comity. While this is a valid concern, it does not fully address whether there's a genuine threat to the law student.
   - **Option B**: This option states that a federal plaintiff may seek declaratory judgment regardless of being threatened by a state prosecution. However, this overlooks the potential for interference with ongoing prosecutions.
   - **Option C**: This option correctly identifies that the law student can show a genuine threat based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings. This aligns well with *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club*.
   - **Option D**: This suggests dismissing the action as premature because of speculative fears, which does not consider the evidence provided by the arrests and warnings.

Given these considerations, the most accurate answer is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly applies the legal principles to the specific facts presented in the scenario.",1.0,"Analyze the context of the question meticulously, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on logical reasoning, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",11
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the numbers without any remainder.

The given orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

To find the LCM, we can use their prime factorizations:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Finding the LCM**:
   The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in these factorizations.
   - For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Therefore, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 = 8 \times 27 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Thus, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is **5400**.

The correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,"Analyze the context of the question meticulously, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on logical reasoning, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",11
