"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done to charge the capacitor),
- \( C \) is the capacitance of the capacitor,
- \( V \) is the potential difference across the capacitor.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

First, calculate \( V^2 \):

\[ V^2 = (100 V)^2 = 10000 V^2 \]

Now substitute this back into the equation:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} J \]
\[ U = 0.005 J \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

So, we need to solve:

\[ (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \]

To find the intervals where this inequality holds true, we determine the roots of the equation \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

Next, we test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied:

- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the inequality \( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \) is satisfied in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

Therefore, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

So, the correct answer is:

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider relevant legal principles, particularly those established by the U.S. Supreme Court regarding declaratory judgment actions and their application in cases involving potential state prosecutions.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that determines the rights of parties without ordering any action or providing relief. The primary purpose is to resolve legal disputes before they lead to actual harm.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent on Declaratory Judgments and State Prosecutions**:
   - In *Warth v. Seldin* (1975), the Supreme Court outlined several criteria for a justiciable case, including that there must be an actual controversy.
   - In *Leser v. Garnett* (1940) and subsequent cases, the Court has recognized that declaratory relief may not be granted if it would interfere with ongoing state prosecutions or otherwise disrupt the normal course of judicial proceedings.

3. **Analysis of Each Option**:
   - **(A)**: This option suggests that the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and thus should be dismissed for reasons of equity and comity. While this is a valid concern, it does not fully address whether there is an actual controversy.
   - **(B)**: This option states that a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute. However, the law student's companions have already been arrested, which suggests a genuine threat of enforcement against him.
   - **(C)**: This option argues that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement based on the arrest of his companions and prior warnings. Given the Supreme Court’s recognition of the need for an actual controversy, this seems to align with established precedent.
   - **(D)**: This option claims that declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears are speculative. While it is true that future arrests are speculative, the arrest of his companions and prior warnings create a concrete threat.

4. **Conclusion**:
Given the Supreme Court’s emphasis on an actual controversy in *Warth v. Seldin* and the fact that the law student can show a genuine threat based on the actions taken against his friends, option (C) is the most accurate answer.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**",0.0,"Analyze the question or provided information meticulously, apply relevant theories or calculations as necessary, eliminate options that do not align with the given context, and select the most accurate answer.",6
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the scenario described.

1. **Nonconducting Sphere with +Q Charge**: This sphere has a net positive charge of +Q. When brought close to another object (in this case, a neutral conducting sphere), it will induce charges on the surface of the conducting sphere due to the electric field created by the nonconducting sphere.

2. **Neutral Conducting Sphere**: A conductor distributes its charge such that the electric field inside is zero. This means any external electric field will cause the free electrons in the conductor to move, redistributing themselves until the net electric field within the conductor is canceled out.

3. **Induced Charges on the Conducting Sphere**:
   - When a positive charge (+Q) approaches a neutral conducting sphere, it repels the free electrons in the conductor towards the side away from the nonconducting sphere.
   - This leaves an excess of positive charges (induced by the external field) on the side of the conducting sphere that is closest to the nonconducting sphere.

4. **Electrostatic Forces**:
   - The induced positive charge on one part of the conducting sphere will attract the +Q charge from the nonconducting sphere.
   - However, due to the redistribution of charges and the overall neutrality of the conductor, there won't be a net charge of –Q on the entire surface; instead, it's the distribution that matters.

Now let's evaluate each option:

(A) **An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
- This is incorrect because in a conductor, the electric field inside must be zero for electrostatic equilibrium.

(B) **The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
- This is not correct either. The charges will redistribute but won't result in a net charge of –Q on the entire surface; only an induced positive charge on one side and negative on the other, maintaining overall neutrality.

(C) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
- This is true because the induced positive charge on the conducting sphere (closest to +Q) will attract the nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge.

(D) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
- This is incorrect as there's no indication of like charges that would cause repulsion; instead, it’s attraction due to opposite induced charges.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the principles of electrostatics and the given context is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",0.0,"Analyze the question or provided information meticulously, apply relevant theories or calculations as necessary, eliminate options that do not align with the given context, and select the most accurate answer.",6
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:
