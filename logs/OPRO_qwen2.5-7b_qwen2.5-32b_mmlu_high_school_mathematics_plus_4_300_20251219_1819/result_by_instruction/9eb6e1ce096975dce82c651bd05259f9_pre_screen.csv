"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, we factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

So, the inequality becomes:

\[ (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \]

To solve this inequality, we find the roots of the equation \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the inequality \( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \) holds for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Next, we need to ensure that the denominator is not zero. The expression under the square root must be strictly greater than zero, so there are no additional restrictions from this part.

Therefore, combining these results, the domain of \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedents and the specific circumstances presented.

### Analysis:

1. **Nature of Declaratory Judgment Action**: A declaratory judgment is a lawsuit brought by one party seeking a court's determination on the rights, status, or legal relations between parties without any actual controversy over which there are adverse legal interests. The primary purpose is to resolve doubts and clarify legal relationships.

2. **Supreme Court Precedents**:
   - **Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores (1980)**: This case established that a declaratory judgment action cannot be used as a substitute for an actual controversy, meaning the court will not issue a declaration if there is no real and immediate threat of enforcement.
   - **Warth v. Seldin (1975)**: The Court emphasized that to have standing to seek a declaratory judgment, a plaintiff must show a ""real and immediate"" threat of enforcement against them.

3. **Application to the Case**:
   - The law student is seeking an advance ruling on the constitutionality of criminal statutes.
   - His companions were arrested for criminal trespass and loitering after continuing their leafleting despite warnings.
   - The law student left voluntarily but fears he might be arrested in the future.

### Evaluating Each Option:

- **Option (A)**: This option suggests that declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions. While this is a valid concern, it does not directly address whether there is an actual threat to the law student.
  
- **Option (B)**: This states that a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute. However, Supreme Court precedents like Blue Chip Stamps and Warth indicate that such relief should be granted only when there is an actual threat of enforcement.
  
- **Option (C)**: This option argues that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings. Given the Supreme Court's emphasis in Blue Chip Stamps and Warth, this seems to align with the requirement for a ""real and immediate"" threat.
  
- **Option (D)**: This suggests that declaratory relief would be premature because the law student’s fears are speculative. While this is true if there were no concrete evidence of an impending arrest, the prior arrests and warnings provide some basis for his concerns.

### Conclusion:

Based on Supreme Court precedents and the specific circumstances provided, **Option (C)** appears to be the most accurate answer. The law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him due to the arrest of his companions and the prior warnings from the police.

**Final Answer: (C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**",1.0,"Analyze the question in detail, apply relevant theories or calculations where needed, eliminate incorrect options logically based on the given information, and select the most precise answer from those provided.",14
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's break down the scenario and apply relevant principles from electrostatics.

### Scenario Analysis:
- **Nonconducting Sphere**: Initially given a net electric charge of +Q. This means it has more positive charges than negative ones.
- **Neutral Conducting Sphere**: Initially uncharged (neither positively nor negatively charged).

When the nonconducting sphere is brought close to the neutral conducting sphere, several electrostatic phenomena will occur due to the presence of an external electric field from the nonconducting sphere.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Induced Charges in Conductors**: When a conductor is placed in an electric field, charges within it rearrange themselves such that the internal electric field inside the conductor becomes zero.
2. **Electrostatic Induction**: The process by which charges are induced on the surface of a conductor when another charged object approaches.

### Analysis:
- **Option (A): An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
  - This is incorrect because in a conductor, the internal electric field must be zero due to the free movement of charges that rearrange themselves to cancel out any external fields inside the material.
  
- **Option (B): The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
  - This is also incorrect. While there will be induced charges on the surface, these charges will not result in a net overall charge for the conductor since it was initially neutral and the total charge must remain zero.

- **Option (C): The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
  - This is correct. When the nonconducting sphere with +Q approaches the conducting sphere, the induced negative charges on the side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere will be attracted by the positive charge of the nonconducting sphere.

- **Option (D): The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
  - This is incorrect because there are no net charges on either sphere that would result in a repulsive force between them after the induced charges have stabilized.

### Conclusion:
The most precise answer, based on the principles of electrostatics and the behavior of conductors in electric fields, is:

**(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**",0.0,"Analyze the question in detail, apply relevant theories or calculations where needed, eliminate incorrect options logically based on the given information, and select the most precise answer from those provided.",14
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the numbers without any remainder.

Given:
- Planet X takes 360 days.
- Planet Y takes 450 days.
- Planet Z takes 540 days.

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Identify the Highest Powers of Each Prime**:
   - For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

3. **Calculate LCM**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2
   \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     - \(2^3 = 8\)
     - \(3^3 = 27\)
     - \(5^2 = 25\)

4. **Multiply the Results**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 8 \times 27 \times 25
   \]
   - First, multiply 8 and 27:
     \[
     8 \times 27 = 216
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by 25:
     \[
     216 \times 25 = 5400
     \]

Thus, the least common multiple of 360, 450, and 540 is 5400.

### Conclusion:

The minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,"Analyze the question in detail, apply relevant theories or calculations where needed, eliminate incorrect options logically based on the given information, and select the most precise answer from those provided.",14
