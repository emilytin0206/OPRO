"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this scenario comprehensively, let's break down the key elements and deduce the most accurate answer:

1. **Nonconducting Sphere with +Q Charge**: This sphere has a net positive charge of +Q.

2. **Neutral Conducting Sphere**: Initially, this sphere has no net electric charge (neutral).

3. **Interaction Between Spheres**: When the nonconducting sphere is brought close to the neutral conducting sphere, we need to consider how charges will redistribute due to the influence of the external electric field created by the +Q charge.

### Key Concepts:
- **Induced Charges in Conductors**: In a conductor, free electrons can move freely. When an external electric field is applied (in this case, by the nonconducting sphere), these free electrons will rearrange themselves within the conductor to oppose the external field.
- **Electrostatic Induction**: This process results in the appearance of induced charges on the surface of the conducting sphere.

### Analysis:
- **Option A: An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
  - While an electric field is indeed induced, this statement does not directly address what happens to the net charge or the interaction between the spheres.
  
- **Option B: The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
  - This option suggests that the entire neutral conductor would become negatively charged. However, in reality, only an equal and opposite charge will appear on one side (near the nonconducting sphere) while the other side will have an equal positive charge to maintain overall neutrality.
  
- **Option C: The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
  - Since the nonconducting sphere has a net +Q charge, it will induce a negative charge near its surface on the conducting sphere and a positive charge on the opposite side of the conducting sphere. This setup results in an attractive force between the two spheres due to the opposite charges.
  
- **Option D: The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
  - This is incorrect because the induced charges on the conducting sphere create an overall attraction, not repulsion.

### Conclusion:
The most accurate answer based on the principles of electrostatic induction and charge distribution in conductors is:

**C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**

This conclusion is derived from understanding that the nonconducting sphere's +Q charge induces a –Q charge near one side of the conducting sphere, leading to an attractive force between the two spheres.",0.0,"Analyze the scenario or question comprehensively, identify key elements, and deduce the most accurate answer from the provided options.",2
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (work required),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\( C \)) = 10 µF = \( 10 \times 10^{-6} \, F \)
- Potential difference (\( V \)) = 100 V

Now we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} \, F) \times (100 \, V)^2 \]

First, calculate \( V^2 \):

\[ V^2 = (100 \, V)^2 = 10000 \, V^2 \]

Now substitute this back into the equation:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.1 \, J \]
\[ U = 0.05 \, J \]

Therefore, the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V is:

"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to identify where the expression is defined. Specifically, we must ensure that the denominator is not zero and that it does not involve taking the square root of a negative number.

### Step 1: Identify the conditions for the denominator
The denominator is \( \sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 4} \). For this to be defined:
- The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero (since it's under a square root and in the denominator).

### Step 2: Solve the inequality
We need to solve the inequality:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

So, we have:
\[ (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \]

### Step 3: Determine the intervals
To solve this inequality, find the roots of the equation \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \):
- The roots are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \).

These roots divide the real number line into three intervals:
\[ (-\infty, -1), \quad (-1, 4), \quad (4, \infty) \]

### Step 4: Test each interval
We need to test a point in each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \):
  Choose \( x = -2 \):
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]

- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \):
  Choose \( x = 0 \):
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \):
  Choose \( x = 5 \):
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

### Step 5: Combine the results
The inequality \( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \) holds in the intervals:
\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

### Conclusion
Therefore, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:
\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to analyze the scenario in light of relevant Supreme Court precedents regarding declaratory judgment actions. The key elements here include:

1. **Nature of the Action**: A declaratory judgment action is being filed by a law student seeking an advance ruling on the constitutionality of criminal statutes.
2. **Existing Prosecutions and Threats**: There are existing state prosecutions (arrests) against his companions, but not directly against him at this moment.
3. **Supreme Court Precedents**: The Supreme Court has established certain criteria for granting declaratory relief, particularly in cases where there is a threat of enforcement.

Let's examine each option:

(A) **Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**
- This option suggests that the court will dismiss the action because it interferes with ongoing state proceedings. However, this is not necessarily true based on Supreme Court precedents like *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club* (1972), which held that a declaratory judgment can be granted even when there are existing prosecutions.

(B) **No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.**
- This option is incorrect as it does not consider the specific circumstances of the case and the potential for future enforcement against the law student.

(C) **No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**
- This option aligns with Supreme Court precedents which allow declaratory relief when there is a ""genuine"" or ""real and immediate"" threat of enforcement. The arrests of his friends and the warnings from the police provide evidence that he could be subject to similar enforcement.

(D) **Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.**
- This option suggests that the action is premature due to speculation about future events. However, Supreme Court cases like *Warth v. Seldin* (1975) have established that a declaratory judgment can be granted even if there is no immediate threat of enforcement but a genuine and imminent danger.

Given these considerations, the most accurate answer based on Supreme Court precedent is:

**C: No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly identifies that the law student has shown a real and immediate threat of enforcement, which justifies seeking declaratory relief in federal court.",0.0,"Analyze the scenario or question comprehensively, identify key elements, and deduce the most accurate answer from the provided options.",2
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we identify the highest power of each prime factor that appears in these factorizations:
- The highest power of 2 is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\) (from 450).

The LCM is found by multiplying these highest powers together:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now, we calculate this product step-by-step:
\[ 2^3 = 8 \]
\[ 3^3 = 27 \]
\[ 5^2 = 25 \]

Then multiply these results together:
\[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
\[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.
