"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's break down the scenario and apply relevant principles from electrostatics.

### Scenario:
- A nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Induced Charges in Conductors**: When a charged object (in this case, the nonconducting sphere) approaches a conductor, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. The side of the conductor closest to the charge will develop an induced negative charge, and the far side will develop an induced positive charge.
2. **Electrostatic Forces**: Opposite charges attract each other, while like charges repel.

### Analysis:
- Since the nonconducting sphere has a net positive charge +Q, it will induce a negative charge on the side of the conducting sphere closest to it and a positive charge on the opposite side.
- The induced negative charge on the nearest part of the conducting sphere will experience an attractive force towards the positive charge of the nonconducting sphere. However, this is not enough to change the net charge of the entire conducting sphere because charges can move freely within conductors.

### Evaluating Each Option:
(A) **An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
   - This statement is true but does not fully describe what happens at a macroscopic level. The electric field inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is zero, so this option alone doesn't capture the full picture of charge redistribution.

(B) **The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
   - This is incorrect because charges can move freely within conductors and will rearrange themselves to cancel out any external field inside the conductor. The net charge on the conducting sphere remains zero, but there are induced charges on its surface.

(C) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
   - This statement is true in a general sense because the positive charge of the nonconducting sphere will attract the negative charge that has been induced on the nearest part of the conducting sphere. However, this does not fully describe the interaction between the two spheres.

(D) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
   - This is incorrect because there are no like charges (positive to positive or negative to negative) between the two spheres that would result in repulsion. The only significant force is the attraction due to opposite charges.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the most accurate answer based on the principles of electrostatics and charge induction in conductors is:

**(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**

This option correctly describes the interaction between the two spheres due to the induced negative charge on the nearest part of the conducting sphere attracting the positive charge of the nonconducting sphere.",0.0,"Analyze the question in detail, apply relevant theories or calculations as necessary, eliminate incorrect options based on provided information, and select the most accurate answer from those given.",17
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, we factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \).

Next, we determine where this product is greater than zero. The roots of the equation are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:

- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x < -1 \) and \( x > 4 \). Therefore, the domain of the function must exclude the interval where the expression under the square root is non-positive.

Additionally, we need to ensure that the denominator is not zero. The roots of the equation are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \), which means these values cannot be in the domain since they would make the denominator zero.

Combining these conditions, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider relevant legal principles, particularly those related to declaratory judgment actions and the standards for obtaining such relief. Let’s analyze each option in detail:

(A) **Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**
- This option suggests that a federal court should dismiss the action because it might interfere with ongoing state proceedings. However, this reasoning is more applicable to cases where there's an actual or imminent threat of prosecution, which isn't necessarily present here.

(B) **No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.**
- This option is incorrect as it misinterprets the legal standards for seeking declaratory relief. The availability of declaratory relief does not depend solely on whether there's an existing threat or prosecution; rather, it depends on whether there’s a genuine controversy.

(C) **No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**
- This option is plausible. The Supreme Court has recognized that declaratory relief may be granted when there's a ""genuine"" or ""real and immediate"" threat of enforcement. The fact that the law student’s friends were arrested and warned provides evidence of such a threat.

(D) **Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.**
- This option suggests that the action should be dismissed due to the speculative nature of the law student's fears. However, the Supreme Court has held that declaratory judgments can be granted even if there is no immediate threat but where there’s a genuine and imminent risk.

Given these considerations, the most accurate answer based on legal principles and precedent would be:

**C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly identifies that the law student has demonstrated a real and immediate risk of prosecution, which is sufficient to justify seeking declaratory relief in federal court.",0.0,"Analyze the question in detail, apply relevant theories or calculations as necessary, eliminate incorrect options based on provided information, and select the most accurate answer from those given.",17
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers without any remainder.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Identify the Highest Powers of Each Prime**:
   - For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

3. **Calculate LCM**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2
   \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     - \(2^3 = 8\)
     - \(3^3 = 27\)
     - \(5^2 = 25\)

4. **Multiply the Results**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 8 \times 27 \times 25
   \]
   - First, multiply 8 and 27:
     \[
     8 \times 27 = 216
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by 25:
     \[
     216 \times 25 = 5400
     \]

Thus, the least common multiple of 360, 450, and 540 is 5400.

### Conclusion:

The minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,"Analyze the question in detail, apply relevant theories or calculations as necessary, eliminate incorrect options based on provided information, and select the most accurate answer from those given.",17
