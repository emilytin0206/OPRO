"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's break down each option and consider the principles involved in electrostatics.

### Given Information:
- A nonconducting sphere with a net electric charge \(+Q\).
- A neutral conducting sphere of the same radius as the nonconducting sphere.
- The nonconducting sphere is brought close to the conducting sphere.

### Analysis:

1. **Option (A): An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
   - When a charged object approaches a conductor, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. Specifically, the side of the conductor closest to the charge will develop an opposite charge, and the far side will develop a similar charge.
   - This is due to the redistribution of free electrons in the conductor under the influence of the external electric field created by the nonconducting sphere.

2. **Option (B): The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
   - A neutral conducting sphere cannot have a net charge because, by definition, it has an equal number of positive and negative charges.
   - However, there can be induced charges on its surface due to the external field but not a net charge.

3. **Option (C): The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
   - An electric field from the nonconducting sphere will induce opposite charges on the conducting sphere's side facing the nonconducting sphere.
   - This induces a negative charge on that side and a positive charge on the far side of the conducting sphere.
   - Since like charges repel, there is an electrostatic repulsion between the two spheres.

4. **Option (D): The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
   - As explained in option (C), the induced negative charge on the side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere will repel the positive charge of the nonconducting sphere.
   - This results in a net repulsive force between the two spheres.

### Conclusion:
- The most accurate answer is **(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
  - This is because the induced negative charge on one side of the conducting sphere and the positive charge of the nonconducting sphere result in a repulsive force.
  
Therefore, the correct choice is (D).",0.0,"Analyze the question thoroughly, integrate relevant concepts or calculations, critically evaluate each option based on the provided information, and select the most accurate answer.",13
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

So, we need to solve:

\[ (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \]

To find the intervals where this inequality holds true, we determine the roots of the equation \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

Next, we test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the inequality \( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \) is satisfied in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero, we exclude the points where the expression under the square root equals zero, which are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \). Therefore, these points must also be excluded from the domain.

Combining all this information, the domain of the function is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

Calculate step by step:
1. Calculate \( V^2 \):
   \[ V^2 = (100 V)^2 = 10000 V^2 \]
2. Multiply the capacitance by \( V^2 \):
   \[ C \times V^2 = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \times 10000 V^2 = 10 \times 10^{-2} J = 0.1 J \]
3. Finally, multiply by \( \frac{1}{2} \):
   \[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.1 J = 0.05 J \]

Therefore, the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V is:

\[ \boxed{0.05 J} \]

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider several legal principles related to declaratory judgment actions, particularly as they pertain to federal court jurisdiction and the standards for granting such relief.

1. **Declaratory Judgment Act (DJA) and Federal Jurisdiction**: The Declaratory Judgment Act allows a party to seek a declaration of their rights or status from a court without necessarily having an actual controversy that would otherwise require a lawsuit. However, there must be a ""case or controversy"" as required by Article III of the U.S. Constitution.

2. **Existing State Prosecutions and Equitable Considerations**: The Supreme Court has held in cases such as *O'Shea v. Littleton* (1980) that declaratory relief may not be granted if it would interfere with ongoing state prosecutions or otherwise disrupt the normal functioning of state courts, which is a principle of equity and comity.

3. **Threat of Enforcement**: For a federal court to grant declaratory relief, there must be a genuine threat of enforcement against the plaintiff. The Supreme Court has emphasized that the existence of a ""real and immediate"" threat is necessary for a case or controversy under Article III.

4. **Speculative Fears vs. Concrete Threats**: Courts generally do not entertain claims based on speculative fears unless those fears are sufficiently concrete to create an actual, imminent risk of enforcement against the plaintiff.

Given these principles:

- Option (A) suggests that declaratory relief would be disallowed due to interference with existing state prosecutions and concerns about equity and comity. This is a valid concern but not necessarily the most accurate answer based on the specific facts provided.
  
- Option (B) states that a federal plaintiff may seek declaratory judgment even if they are not directly threatened by a state prosecution, which is generally true but does not fully address the need for a genuine threat of enforcement.

- Option (C) correctly identifies that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on the arrest of his companions and prior warnings. This aligns with the requirement for a ""case or controversy"" under Article III, making it the most accurate answer.

- Option (D) suggests that declaratory relief would be premature because the fears are speculative. While this is a valid concern, it does not fully consider the concrete threat of enforcement against the law student based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly identifies that there is a ""case or controversy"" due to the concrete threat of enforcement, which satisfies the Article III requirements for federal court jurisdiction in this context.",0.0,"Analyze the question thoroughly, integrate relevant concepts or calculations, critically evaluate each option based on the provided information, and select the most accurate answer.",13
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers without a remainder.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:
