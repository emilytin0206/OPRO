"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the scenario described.

1. **Induced Electric Field (Option A):**
   - When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere. This is because the presence of the charged nonconducting sphere will cause charges in the conducting sphere to rearrange themselves due to electrostatic induction.

2. **Net Electric Charge on the Conducting Sphere (Option B):**
   - The conducting sphere initially has no net charge, but when brought close to a positively charged object, it will not develop an equal and opposite charge of –Q. Instead, charges within the conductor will rearrange themselves such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. This means positive charges on the side facing the nonconducting sphere will be pushed away from the surface towards the back, while negative charges will move to the front.

3. **Electrostatic Forces (Options C and D):**
   - The electrostatic force between two objects depends on their charges and the distance between them. Since the conducting sphere initially has no net charge, it does not have a net electric field outside of itself in its neutral state. However, due to induction, there will be an induced negative charge distribution on the side facing the nonconducting sphere and a corresponding positive charge distribution on the opposite side.
   - The overall effect is that the conducting sphere will experience an attractive force towards the nonconducting sphere because the induced charges create an electric field that attracts the positively charged nonconducting sphere.

Given these considerations, we can conclude:

- **Option A** is correct in stating that an electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
- **Option B** is incorrect as the conducting sphere does not develop a net charge of –Q; instead, it redistributes its charges to induce fields.
- **Option C** is correct because the spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction due to the induced charges on the conducting sphere.

However, since we need to select the most precise answer based on the provided options and the core question about what will be true:

The best answer is:
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",1.0,"Analyze the question carefully, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on the provided information, and select the most precise answer from those given.",12
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work required to charge the capacitor),
- \( C \) is the capacitance of the capacitor,
- \( V \) is the potential difference across the capacitor.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

First, calculate \( (100 V)^2 \):

\[ (100 V)^2 = 10000 V^2 \]

Now substitute this back into the equation:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times 10000 V^2 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 \times 10^{-3} J \]
\[ U = 50 \times 10^{-3} J \]
\[ U = 0.05 J \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider relevant legal principles, particularly those related to declaratory judgment actions and the standards for obtaining such relief. The key Supreme Court precedent here is likely derived from the Declaratory Judgment Act (D.J.A.) of 1934, which was designed to provide a means for individuals to seek clarification on their rights without having to wait until they are threatened with prosecution.

The correct answer is:

(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.

Here's why this option is correct based on legal principles:

1. **Genuine Threat of Enforcement**: The Supreme Court has held that for declaratory relief to be granted, there must be a ""genuine"" or ""real and immediate"" threat of enforcement against the plaintiff. In this case, the arrest of his companions and prior warnings from the police provide evidence of such a threat.

2. **Equity and Comity**: While equity and comity are important considerations in federal court decisions, they do not necessarily preclude granting declaratory relief if there is a genuine threat of enforcement. The Supreme Court has recognized that declaratory judgments can be issued to prevent imminent harm or to clarify legal rights before an actual dispute arises.

3. **Prematurity**: Prematurity would suggest that the law student's fears are speculative, but given the concrete actions taken against his companions and the warnings received, these fears cannot be considered entirely speculative.

4. **Federal Plaintiff's Rights**: The federal plaintiff (the law student) has a right to seek declaratory relief even if he is not directly threatened with prosecution under state statutes. This is because declaratory judgments can serve as a means of preventing future conflicts and clarifying legal rights.

Therefore, based on the Supreme Court precedent that supports the issuance of declaratory judgments when there is a genuine threat of enforcement, option (C) is the most precise answer.",1.0,"Analyze the question carefully, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on the provided information, and select the most precise answer from those given.",12
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

So, we need to solve:

\[ (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \]

To find the intervals where this inequality holds true, we determine the roots of the equation \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

Next, we test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the inequality \( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \) is satisfied in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero, we exclude the points where the expression under the square root equals zero, which are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \). Therefore, the domain of the function is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the numbers without any remainder.

The given orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

To find the LCM, we can use their prime factorizations:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **LCM Calculation**:
   The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in these factorizations.
   - For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Therefore, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 = 8 \times 27 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Thus, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is **5400**.

The correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,"Analyze the question carefully, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on the provided information, and select the most precise answer from those given.",12
