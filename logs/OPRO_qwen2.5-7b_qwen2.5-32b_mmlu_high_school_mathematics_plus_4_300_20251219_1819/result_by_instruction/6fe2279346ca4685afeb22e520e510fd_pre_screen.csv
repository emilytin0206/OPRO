"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedent. The key here is understanding when a federal court can issue a declaratory judgment and whether such an action would interfere with ongoing state proceedings.

### Analysis:

1. **Supreme Court Precedent on Declaratory Judgments:**
   - The Declaratory Judgment Act (DJA) allows parties to seek a declaration of their rights, status, or other legal relations without having to wait for actual enforcement.
   - However, the Supreme Court has established certain limitations and conditions under which declaratory judgments can be issued. One such limitation is that the court will not issue a declaratory judgment if it would interfere with ongoing state prosecutions.

2. **Interference with State Prosecutions:**
   - The primary concern in this scenario is whether issuing a declaratory judgment would interfere with or disrupt existing state criminal proceedings.
   - In *Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman* (1981), the Supreme Court held that federal courts should not issue declaratory judgments that would interfere with ongoing state prosecutions.

3. **Application to the Given Scenario:**
   - The law student has filed a declaratory judgment action in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of criminal statutes.
   - His companions have already been arrested for criminal trespass and loitering, indicating that there is an existing threat of enforcement against them.

### Evaluation of Each Option:

- **(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**
  - This option aligns well with *Pennhurst* and other Supreme Court precedents that caution against issuing declaratory judgments in cases where it might disrupt ongoing state proceedings.

- **(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.**
  - This option does not consider the specific circumstances of interference with existing prosecutions and thus seems less accurate given the context.

- **(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**
  - While this option acknowledges the existence of a threat, it does not address whether issuing a declaratory judgment would interfere with ongoing state prosecutions, which is a key consideration.

- **(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.**
  - This option focuses on the speculative nature of the law student’s fears but does not address the interference with existing state prosecutions, making it less relevant to the core issue.

### Conclusion:

The most accurate answer is **(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.** This option correctly identifies that issuing a declaratory judgment in this case could disrupt ongoing state proceedings, aligning with Supreme Court precedent on declaratory judgments.",0.0,"Analyze the question or provided context thoroughly, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, critically evaluate each option, and select the most accurate answer based on the given information.",6
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

So, we need to solve:

\[ (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \]

To find the intervals where this inequality holds true, we determine the roots of the equation \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

Next, we test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the inequality \( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \) is satisfied in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero, we exclude the points where the expression under the square root equals zero, which are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \). Therefore, these points must also be excluded from the domain.

Combining all this information, the domain of the function is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's break down each option and apply relevant principles from electrostatics.

### Given Information:
- A nonconducting sphere with a net electric charge \( +Q \).
- A neutral conducting sphere of the same radius as the nonconducting sphere.
- The nonconducting sphere is brought close to the conducting sphere.

### Analysis:

1. **Option (A): An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
   - When a charged object approaches a conductor, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. These induced charges rearrange themselves such that the electric field inside the conductor remains zero.
   - Therefore, an electric field is indeed induced within the conducting sphere.

2. **Option (B): The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
   - In a conductor, charges can move freely to neutralize any external fields. When the nonconducting sphere with \( +Q \) approaches the neutral conducting sphere, the free electrons in the conducting sphere will be attracted towards the side closest to the nonconducting sphere.
   - This leaves an equal amount of positive charge on the opposite side of the conductor. The net effect is that the conducting sphere does not develop a net electric charge of \( -Q \); instead, it develops a distribution of charges such that the overall field inside remains zero.

3. **Option (C): The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
   - Since one sphere has a positive charge and the other initially had no net charge but now has induced charges, there is indeed an attractive force between them due to the opposite charges on their surfaces.
   - This is because like charges repel and unlike charges attract.

4. **Option (D): The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
   - As explained in option (C), the presence of a positive charge \( +Q \) from one sphere and induced charges on the other sphere results in an attractive force, not a repulsive one.

### Conclusion:
- Option (A) is correct because an electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
- Option (B) is incorrect as the net charge on the conducting sphere does not become \( -Q \).
- Options (C) and (D) are related to the nature of the force between the spheres, but since the charges are opposite in nature due to induction, there will be an attractive force.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the given information is:

**The correct option is (A): An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**",0.0,"Analyze the question or provided context thoroughly, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, critically evaluate each option, and select the most accurate answer based on the given information.",6
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Identify the Highest Powers of Each Prime**:
   - For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

3. **Calculate LCM**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2
   \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     - \(2^3 = 8\)
     - \(3^3 = 27\)
     - \(5^2 = 25\)

4. **Multiply the Results**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 8 \times 27 \times 25
   \]
   - First, multiply 8 and 27:
     \[
     8 \times 27 = 216
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by 25:
     \[
     216 \times 25 = 5400
     \]

Thus, the least common multiple of 360, 450, and 540 is 5400.

### Conclusion:

The minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,"Analyze the question or provided context thoroughly, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, critically evaluate each option, and select the most accurate answer based on the given information.",6
