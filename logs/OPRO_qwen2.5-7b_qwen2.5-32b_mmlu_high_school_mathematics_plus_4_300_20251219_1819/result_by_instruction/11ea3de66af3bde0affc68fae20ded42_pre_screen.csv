"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the numerator and the denominator are defined. Specifically, for the square root in the denominator, the expression inside must be positive because the square root of a negative number is not real, and division by zero is undefined.

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Identify where the denominator is defined:**
   The denominator is \(\sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 4}\). For the expression under the square root to be defined (and positive), we need:
   \[
   x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0
   \]

2. **Solve the inequality \(x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0\):**
   First, solve the equation \(x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0\) to find the critical points.
   \[
   x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) = 0
   \]
   So, the roots are:
   \[
   x = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -1
   \]

3. **Determine the intervals where \(x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0\):**
   The critical points divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -1)\), \((-1, 4)\), and \((4, \infty)\). We test a point in each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

   - For \(x \in (-\infty, -1)\):
     Choose \(x = -2\):
     \[
     (-2)^2 - 3(-2) - 4 = 4 + 6 - 4 = 6 > 0
     \]
     So, the inequality holds in \((-\infty, -1)\).

   - For \(x \in (-1, 4)\):
     Choose \(x = 0\):
     \[
     0^2 - 3(0) - 4 = -4 < 0
     \]
     So, the inequality does not hold in \((-1, 4)\).

   - For \(x \in (4, \infty)\):
     Choose \(x = 5\):
     \[
     5^2 - 3(5) - 4 = 25 - 15 - 4 = 6 > 0
     \]
     So, the inequality holds in \((4, \infty)\).

4. **Combine the intervals where the inequality is satisfied:**
   The expression \(x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0\) is true for:
   \[
   x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty)
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   Therefore, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:
   \[
   (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty)
   \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's break down the scenario and apply relevant principles from electrostatics.

### Scenario Analysis:
- **Nonconducting Sphere**: Initially given a net electric charge of +Q. This means it has more positive charges than negative ones.
- **Neutral Conducting Sphere**: Initially neutral (no net charge), meaning it has an equal number of positive and negative charges, but they are distributed in such a way that the overall charge is zero.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Induced Charges on Conductors**:
   - When a charged object approaches a conductor, the free electrons within the conductor will be displaced by the external electric field created by the charged object.
   
2. **Electrostatic Induction**:
   - The induced charges rearrange themselves in such a way that they oppose the external charge to minimize the overall potential energy of the system.

3. **Electric Field and Force Between Spheres**:
   - The force between two charged objects depends on their charges and the distance between them.
   - Like charges repel, opposite charges attract.

### Applying the Concepts:

1. **Induced Charges (Option A)**:
   - When the positively charged nonconducting sphere approaches the neutral conducting sphere, the free electrons in the conducting sphere will be pushed to one side by the external electric field of the +Q charge.
   - This results in a net positive charge on the side of the conducting sphere facing the nonconducting sphere and an equal negative charge on the opposite side.

2. **Net Charge on Conducting Sphere (Option B)**:
   - The conducting sphere will not develop a net charge of –Q because it is neutral initially, and the redistribution of charges does not change its overall neutrality.
   
3. **Electrostatic Forces Between Spheres**:
   - Since one side of the conducting sphere has an induced positive charge (+Q) and the nonconducting sphere has +Q, there will be a repulsive force between these like charges.
   - The other side of the conducting sphere with an induced negative charge (-Q) will experience an attractive force towards the nonconducting sphere.

### Conclusion:
- **Option A**: An electric field is indeed induced within the conducting sphere due to the redistribution of charges. This statement is correct.
- **Option B**: The conducting sphere does not develop a net charge of –Q; it remains neutral overall. This option is incorrect.
- **Options C and D**: Both statements are true in different contexts, but since we need to select the most precise answer based on the provided information, we focus on the induced electric field.

### Final Answer:
The correct answer is (A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.",0.0,"Analyze the question in detail, apply necessary theories or calculations, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer based on the provided information.",9
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\( C \)) = 10 µF = \( 10 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F} \)
- Potential difference (\( V \)) = 100 V

Now we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F}) \times (100 \, \text{V})^2 \]

First, calculate \( V^2 \):

\[ V^2 = (100)^2 = 10000 \, \text{V}^2 \]

Next, substitute this value back into the equation:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.1 \]
\[ U = 0.05 \, \text{J} \]

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To analyze this question accurately, we need to consider several legal principles, particularly those related to declaratory judgment actions and the standards for obtaining such relief. Let’s break down each option:

(A) **Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**
- This option suggests that a federal court should dismiss the action because it might interfere with ongoing state proceedings. However, this reasoning is more applicable to cases where there's an actual or imminent threat of prosecution, which isn't necessarily present here.

(B) **No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.**
- This option is incorrect as it misinterprets the legal standards for seeking declaratory relief. The law student must show that there's an actual or imminent threat of enforcement against him.

(C) **No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**
- This option is plausible. The Supreme Court has recognized that declaratory relief may be granted when there’s a ""genuine"" or ""real and immediate"" threat of enforcement. The fact that the law student's friends were arrested and he received warnings provides evidence of such a threat.

(D) **Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.**
- This option is incorrect as it suggests that the fear must be purely speculative for the action to be dismissed. The Supreme Court has allowed declaratory judgments even when there’s a reasonable likelihood of enforcement.

Given these considerations, the most precise answer based on Supreme Court precedent and legal principles would be:

**C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly identifies that the law student has demonstrated a real and immediate threat of enforcement, which is sufficient to justify seeking declaratory relief in federal court.",0.0,"Analyze the question in detail, apply necessary theories or calculations, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer based on the provided information.",9
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Identify the Highest Powers of Each Prime**:
   - For \(2\): The highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\): The highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\): The highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

3. **Calculate the LCM**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2
   \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     - \(2^3 = 8\)
     - \(3^3 = 27\)
     - \(5^2 = 25\)

4. **Multiply the Results**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 8 \times 27 \times 25
   \]
   - First, multiply 8 and 27:
     \[
     8 \times 27 = 216
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by 25:
     \[
     216 \times 25 = 5400
     \]

Thus, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.

The correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,"Analyze the question in detail, apply necessary theories or calculations, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer based on the provided information.",9
