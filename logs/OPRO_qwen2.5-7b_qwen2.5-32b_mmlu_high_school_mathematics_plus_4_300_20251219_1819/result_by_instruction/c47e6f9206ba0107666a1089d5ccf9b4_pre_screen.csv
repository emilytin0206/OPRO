"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 0.005 J.",0.0,"Analyze the question deeply, apply relevant theories or calculations where needed, eliminate incorrect options based on the given information, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",19
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's break down the scenario and apply relevant principles from electrostatics.

1. **Initial Setup**: We have a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius.

2. **Electric Field Induction in Conductors**:
   - When a charged object is placed near a conductor, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. The induced charges rearrange themselves such that the electric field inside the conductor remains zero (one of the fundamental properties of conductors).

3. **Induced Charges on the Conducting Sphere**:
   - Since the nonconducting sphere has a positive charge +Q, it will induce an equal and opposite negative charge –Q on one side of the conducting sphere and a corresponding positive charge +Q on the other side to maintain electrical neutrality overall but with induced charges.

4. **Electrostatic Forces Between Spheres**:
   - The electrostatic force between two charged objects is given by Coulomb's Law: \( F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \), where \(k\) is Coulomb’s constant, \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) are the charges, and \(r\) is the distance between them.
   - In this case, one sphere has a net charge +Q (the nonconducting sphere) and the other has an induced –Q on its side facing the nonconducting sphere. The conducting sphere will experience an attractive force due to the positive charge of the nonconducting sphere.

5. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere**: This is true because the presence of a charged object near a conductor induces charges on its surface, but the electric field inside remains zero.
   - **(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q**: This is incorrect. While there are induced charges, they do not result in a net charge on the entire conducting sphere; it remains neutral overall due to the redistribution of charges.
   - **(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction**: This is correct because the positive charge on one sphere attracts the negative charge that has been induced on the other sphere.
   - **(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion**: This is incorrect as there are no like charges directly interacting; instead, it's a case of opposite charges attracting.

Therefore, based on the analysis and principles of electrostatics, the most accurate answer is:

**(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**",0.0,"Analyze the question deeply, apply relevant theories or calculations where needed, eliminate incorrect options based on the given information, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",19
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, we factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \).

Next, we determine where this product is greater than zero. The roots of the equation are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:

- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x < -1 \) and \( x > 4 \). Therefore, the domain of the function must exclude the interval where the expression under the square root is non-positive.

Additionally, we need to ensure that the denominator is not zero. The points where the denominator would be zero are at \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \), which we have already excluded from our solution since they make the expression under the square root non-positive.

Therefore, combining these results, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedent. The key points to analyze include:

1. **Nature of Declaratory Judgment**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that determines the rights and obligations of parties without ordering any specific action or awarding damages.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent**: The most relevant case here is likely *O'Shea v. Littleton* (414 U.S. 488, 1974), where the Supreme Court established that a declaratory judgment should not be granted if there is no actual or imminent controversy.

3. **Equity and Comity**: The court may also consider principles of equity and comity when deciding whether to grant declaratory relief, especially in cases involving state prosecutions.

Now let's analyze each option:

(A) **Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**
- This option suggests that the court will dismiss the action because it might interfere with ongoing state proceedings. However, *O'Shea v. Littleton* does not support this blanket dismissal based on interference alone.

(B) **No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.**
- This option is incorrect as it overlooks the requirement for an actual or imminent controversy under *O'Shea v. Littleton*.

(C) **No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**
- This option aligns with the Supreme Court's stance in *O'Shea v. Littleton*, where it was held that a declaratory judgment may be granted if there is an actual or imminent controversy. The law student can indeed show a genuine threat based on the actions taken against his friends.

(D) **Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.**
- This option suggests that the court will dismiss the action due to the speculative nature of the law student’s fears. However, the presence of prior warnings and arrests against his friends can provide sufficient evidence of an imminent threat.

Given these considerations, the most accurate answer is:

**C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly applies Supreme Court precedent and acknowledges the actual or imminent controversy that justifies granting declaratory relief.",0.0,"Analyze the question deeply, apply relevant theories or calculations where needed, eliminate incorrect options based on the given information, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",19
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers without any remainder.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.
