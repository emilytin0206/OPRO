"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, determine where this product is greater than zero. The roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \) are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero and we have already ensured that it is positive in these intervals, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved:

1. **Induced Electric Field in Conductors**: When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, the electric field from the nonconducting sphere will induce charges on the surface of the conducting sphere.

2. **Charge Induction and Distribution**: In a conductor, free electrons can move freely under the influence of an external electric field. When the nonconducting sphere with +Q is brought close to the neutral conducting sphere, the side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere will experience a higher electric field due to the presence of the positive charge. This causes the free electrons in the conductor to move away from this region towards the opposite side of the sphere.

3. **Charge Distribution**: As a result, an equal and opposite charge –Q will be induced on the side of the conducting sphere that is closest to the nonconducting sphere with +Q. The other side of the conducting sphere will have a net positive charge +Q due to the redistribution of electrons.

4. **Electrostatic Forces Between Spheres**: Since one sphere has a net positive charge and the other has an induced negative charge on its surface, there will be an electrostatic attraction between them.

Given these points:

- Option (A) is correct because an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere.
- Option (B) is also correct in terms of the induced charges but not as precise since it only mentions one aspect of the charge distribution.
- Options (C) and (D) are related to the electrostatic forces between the spheres, but we need to determine which force will dominate.

Since the nonconducting sphere has a net positive charge +Q and the conducting sphere now has an induced negative charge –Q on its surface closest to the nonconducting sphere, there will be an attractive force between them due to opposite charges.

Therefore, the most precise answer based on the provided information is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",0.0,"Analyze the problem carefully, apply relevant concepts or calculations, eliminate incorrect options, and select the most precise answer based on the provided information.",3
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the principles established by Supreme Court precedent regarding declaratory judgment actions. Specifically, we should look at how courts handle cases where there is an existing or imminent threat of enforcement against a party.

The key points from the scenario are:
1. The law student has filed for a declaratory judgment.
2. His companions were arrested based on criminal trespass and loitering charges after continuing to leaflet despite warnings.
3. The law student seeks an advance ruling on the constitutionality of these statutes, which could potentially affect him as well.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
- This option suggests that the court should dismiss the action because it might interfere with ongoing state proceedings. However, this is not necessarily a valid reason to dismiss a declaratory judgment action if there's an actual or imminent threat against the plaintiff.

(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
- This option is incorrect as it does not consider the specific circumstances of the case. The law student is indeed facing a genuine threat based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings.

(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
- This option correctly identifies that there is a genuine threat to the law student. The Supreme Court has recognized that declaratory judgments may be granted when there's an actual or imminent threat of enforcement.

(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.
- This option suggests that the action is premature due to speculation about future events. However, given the concrete actions and warnings against the companions, this argument does not hold up as strongly.

Based on these considerations, the most precise answer is:

(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.

This option aligns with Supreme Court precedent that supports granting declaratory judgments when there's an actual or imminent threat to the plaintiff.",0.0,"Analyze the problem carefully, apply relevant concepts or calculations, eliminate incorrect options, and select the most precise answer based on the provided information.",3
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.1 \]
\[ U = 0.05 \, \text{J} \]

Therefore, the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V is:

\(\boxed{0.05 \, \text{J}}\)

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:
