"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the given scenario.

1. **Induced Electric Field (Option A):**
   - When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere. This is because the presence of the charged nonconducting sphere will cause charges in the conducting sphere to rearrange themselves due to electrostatic induction.

2. **Net Electric Charge on Conducting Sphere (Option B):**
   - The conducting sphere initially has no net charge, but when brought close to a positively charged object, it will not develop a net electric charge of –Q. Instead, charges within the conductor will rearrange such that an equal and opposite charge is induced on the side closest to the nonconducting sphere, while the other side will have an equal positive charge. This ensures that the overall charge distribution in the conductor remains balanced.

3. **Electrostatic Forces (Options C & D):**
   - The electrostatic force between two charged objects depends on their charges and the distance between them. Since one object has a net positive charge +Q, and the other will have an induced negative charge –q (where q is less than Q) on its side facing the nonconducting sphere, there will be an attractive force between the spheres due to opposite charges.

Given these considerations:

- Option A is correct because an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere.
- Option B is incorrect as the net charge of the conducting sphere does not become –Q; it becomes partially negative on one side and positive on the other, but the overall net charge remains zero.
- Options C and D are related to the nature of the force between the spheres. Since there will be an attractive force due to opposite charges, options C (attraction) is correct.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the principles of electrostatics is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",1.0,"Analyze the context of the question carefully, apply necessary concepts or calculations, critically evaluate each option, and choose the answer that most accurately reflects the information provided.",4
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider several legal principles, particularly those established by the U.S. Supreme Court regarding declaratory judgment actions and their relationship with existing state prosecutions.

1. **Declaratory Judgment Act (DJA) and Federal Jurisdiction**: The Declaratory Judgment Act allows federal courts to issue a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations whether or not further relief is sought. However, the act does not authorize federal courts to interfere with pending state criminal proceedings unless there's a clear and present danger that the declaratory judgment will interfere with those proceedings.

2. **Supreme Court Precedents**: The Supreme Court has ruled on when declaratory judgments can be issued in cases involving potential conflicts between federal and state laws, particularly in contexts where there is an ongoing or imminent threat of prosecution under state law. Notable cases include *California v. Sierra Club* (1980), which established that a declaratory judgment action may not interfere with pending state prosecutions.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: This option suggests that the federal district court would dismiss the action because it would interfere with existing state prosecutions, citing equity and comity principles. Given the Supreme Court's stance in *California v. Sierra Club*, this is a plausible reason for dismissal.
   - **Option B**: This option states that a federal plaintiff may seek declaratory judgment regardless of whether they are threatened by a state prosecution. However, this overlooks the potential interference with ongoing or imminent state prosecutions, which could be grounds for dismissing such an action.
   - **Option C**: This suggests that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings. While this might support the need for declaratory relief, it does not address whether the court would dismiss the action due to interference with state prosecutions.
   - **Option D**: This option argues that the declaratory relief is premature because the law student's fears are speculative. However, the Supreme Court has recognized that a genuine threat of enforcement can justify seeking declaratory relief.

Given these considerations and the specific context provided by the question, the most accurate answer is:

**(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**

This option correctly identifies that the federal district court might dismiss the action based on the potential interference with ongoing or imminent state prosecutions, aligning with Supreme Court precedents like *California v. Sierra Club*.",0.0,"Analyze the context of the question carefully, apply necessary concepts or calculations, critically evaluate each option, and choose the answer that most accurately reflects the information provided.",4
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, determine where this product is greater than zero. The roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \) are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero and we have already ensured that it is positive in these intervals, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a capacitor, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Now we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

First, calculate \( (100 V)^2 \):

\[ (100 V)^2 = 10000 V^2 \]

Next, multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times 10000 V^2 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 100000 \times 10^{-6} J \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.1 J \]
\[ U = 0.05 J \]

Therefore, the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V is:

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:
