"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedent and the specific circumstances presented.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that determines the rights or obligations of parties without ordering any action other than the declaration itself. The primary purpose is to resolve legal disputes before they lead to actual harm.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent and Equitable Considerations**:
   - In *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club* (1976), the Supreme Court held that a declaratory judgment action can be dismissed if it would interfere with ongoing state prosecutions, as this could disrupt the orderly administration of justice.
   - The principle of comity and equity also plays a role in such decisions, ensuring that federal courts do not unnecessarily interfere with state judicial processes.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - (A) This option aligns well with the principles from *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club*. It suggests that the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and thus be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
   - (B) This is incorrect because it disregards the principle that a federal plaintiff must show a genuine threat of enforcement, which is not required in all cases but is relevant here due to the specific circumstances.
   - (C) While this option acknowledges the arrest of companions as evidence of a potential future threat, it does not address the broader principles of equity and comity that might lead to dismissal. It also assumes a higher likelihood of enforcement against the law student than the Supreme Court precedent suggests.
   - (D) This option is incorrect because while it correctly identifies that the relief may be premature due to speculative fears, it overlooks the specific circumstances where such fears can justify declaratory relief.

Given these considerations and the principles from *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club*, the most accurate answer is:

**(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement thoroughly, apply relevant concepts or calculations methodically, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most accurate answer based on the provided information.",3
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (work required),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\( C \)) = 10 µF = \( 10 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F} \)
- Potential difference (\( V \)) = 100 V

Now we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F}) \times (100 \, \text{V})^2 \]

First, calculate \( V^2 \):

\[ V^2 = (100)^2 = 10000 \, \text{V}^2 \]

Next, substitute this value back into the equation:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.1 \]
\[ U = 0.05 \, \text{J} \]

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To solve this problem, let's analyze each option step-by-step:

(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
- When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, the charges in the conducting sphere will rearrange due to the influence of the external electric field. This rearrangement results in an induced electric field within the conducting sphere. Therefore, this statement is true.

(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
- A conducting sphere cannot have a net charge because any excess charge on a conductor distributes itself uniformly over its surface and the total charge must be zero if it were neutral initially. When brought close to another charged object, charges will rearrange but not change the overall neutrality in terms of net charge. Therefore, this statement is false.

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
- A positive charge (+Q) on one sphere and a neutral conducting sphere will induce a negative charge on the side of the conducting sphere facing +Q and a positive charge on the opposite side. This setup results in an attractive force between the two spheres due to the induced charges. Therefore, this statement is true.

(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.
- Since one sphere has a net positive charge (+Q) and the other develops an induced negative charge (–Q), they would attract each other rather than repel. Therefore, this statement is false.

Based on the analysis:

The correct answer is (C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",1.0,"Analyze the problem statement thoroughly, apply relevant concepts or calculations methodically, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most accurate answer based on the provided information.",3
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, determine where this product is greater than zero. The roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \) are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero and we have already ensured that it is positive in these intervals, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:
