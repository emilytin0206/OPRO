"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

So, we need to solve:

\[ (x-4)(x+1) > 0 \]

To find where this inequality holds true, we determine the roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied:

- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the inequality \( (x-4)(x+1) > 0 \) is satisfied in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

Next, we need to ensure that the denominator \( \sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 4} \neq 0 \). This condition is already met by excluding the points where the expression under the square root equals zero, which are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \).

Therefore, combining these results, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a capacitor, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

Calculate step by step:
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-2} J \]
\[ U = 0.05 J \]

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedents and the specific circumstances presented.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that determines the rights of parties without ordering any action or providing relief. The primary purpose is to resolve legal disputes before they lead to more serious consequences.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent**: In cases like *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club* (1970), the Supreme Court established that a declaratory judgment can be granted even if there's no immediate threat of prosecution, as long as the plaintiff can show a ""real and immediate"" controversy.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: This option suggests dismissing the action due to interference with existing state prosecutions. However, this is not necessarily true because declaratory judgments are generally allowed even if there's an ongoing prosecution.
   - **Option B**: This states that a federal plaintiff can seek a declaratory judgment regardless of whether they are threatened by a state prosecution. While this might be partially correct, it doesn't fully address the ""real and immediate"" controversy requirement.
   - **Option C**: This option correctly identifies that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on the arrest of his companions and prior warnings. The Supreme Court has recognized such threats as sufficient grounds for seeking declaratory relief.
   - **Option D**: This suggests dismissing the action due to premature fears being speculative, which is not accurate given the concrete evidence of past actions and potential future enforcement.

4. **Conclusion**:
Given the analysis, the most precise answer is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly applies the legal principles regarding declaratory judgments and acknowledges the ""real and immediate"" controversy that exists in this case.",1.0,"Analyze the question and provided information meticulously, apply relevant concepts or calculations as necessary, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer from those available.",6
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the given scenario.

1. **Nonconducting Sphere with +Q Charge**: This sphere has a net positive charge of +Q. When brought close to another object (in this case, a neutral conducting sphere), it will induce charges on the surface of the conducting sphere due to the electric field created by the nonconducting sphere.

2. **Neutral Conducting Sphere**: A conductor distributes its charge such that the electric field inside is zero. This means any external electric field will cause the free electrons in the conductor to move and rearrange themselves until the internal electric field cancels out the external one.

3. **Induced Charges on the Conducting Sphere**:
   - When a positive charge (+Q) approaches, it repels the free electrons in the conducting sphere towards the side away from the nonconducting sphere.
   - This leaves an excess of positive charges (protons or ionized atoms) on the side closer to the nonconducting sphere.

4. **Electrostatic Forces**:
   - The induced positive charge on one side of the conducting sphere will attract the +Q charge, leading to a net attractive force between the two spheres.
   - However, since the overall charge of the conducting sphere remains neutral (as it has an equal amount of positive and negative charges), there is no net repulsion.

Now let's evaluate each option:

(A) **An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
- This statement is incorrect because in a conductor, the electric field inside must be zero for electrostatic equilibrium.

(B) **The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
- This is incorrect because while there are excess positive charges on one side and negative charges on the other, the overall charge remains neutral due to the redistribution of charges within the conductor.

(C) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
- This statement is correct. The induced positive charge on the conducting sphere will attract the +Q charge from the nonconducting sphere.

(D) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
- This is incorrect because there is no net excess charge on either sphere that would cause a repulsive force between them.

Therefore, the most precise answer is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",0.0,"Analyze the question and provided information meticulously, apply relevant concepts or calculations as necessary, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer from those available.",6
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM will give us the minimum number of days after which all three planets will be in their initial positions relative to each other again.

The given orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:
