"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a capacitor, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

Calculate step by step:
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-2} J \]
\[ U = 0.05 J \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"The correct answer is (C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.

Explanation:

1. **Supreme Court Precedent**: The key principle here involves the Declaratory Judgment Act (28 U.S.C. § 2201) and how federal courts handle declaratory judgment actions. A significant case that addresses this issue is *Warth v. Seldin* (1975), where the Supreme Court outlined criteria for when a court should grant or deny a declaratory judgment.

2. **Genuine Threat of Enforcement**: In *Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co.*, 473 U.S. 479 (1985), the Supreme Court clarified that a plaintiff must show a ""real and immediate"" threat of enforcement to obtain declaratory relief. The arrest of his companions and prior warnings from the police provide evidence of this real and immediate threat.

3. **Equity and Comity**: While option (A) mentions equity and comity, these are not directly relevant in determining whether the court should grant a declaratory judgment based on *Sedima* principles. The focus is more on the immediacy and reality of the threat faced by the law student.

4. **Prematurity of the Action**: Option (D) suggests that the action is premature because the law student's fears are speculative, but this does not align with the Supreme Court’s criteria for granting declaratory relief as established in *Sedima*.

5. **Federal Plaintiff's Rights**: Option (B) incorrectly states that a federal plaintiff can seek declaratory judgment regardless of state prosecution threats, which is not accurate based on the Supreme Court's criteria.

Therefore, considering these points and the relevant legal principles, option (C) correctly identifies the basis for why the federal district court would likely deny dismissal of the declaratory judgment action.",1.0,"Analyze each option carefully, apply relevant principles or calculations, and select the most accurate answer.",2
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

So, we need to solve:

\[ (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \]

To find the intervals where this inequality holds true, we determine the roots of the equation \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

Next, we test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the inequality \( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \) is satisfied in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero, we exclude the points where the expression under the square root equals zero, which are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \). Therefore, the domain of the function is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the given scenario.

1. **Induced Electric Field (Option A):**
   - When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere. This is because the presence of the charged sphere will cause charges in the conducting sphere to rearrange themselves due to electrostatic induction.

2. **Net Electric Charge on the Conducting Sphere (Option B):**
   - A neutral conducting sphere does not have a net charge, and when brought close to another charged object, it will redistribute its charges but will not acquire a net charge of –Q or +Q. Instead, it will develop induced charges that are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign on the side closest to the nonconducting sphere.

3. **Electrostatic Forces (Options C and D):**
   - The electrostatic force between two charged objects depends on their charges and the distance between them. Since the conducting sphere initially has no net charge, it will not have a net charge of –Q or +Q due to induction alone.
   - However, because the nonconducting sphere is positively charged (+Q), the side of the conducting sphere closest to it will develop an induced negative charge, and the far side will develop an induced positive charge. This setup results in an overall attractive force between the two spheres.

Given these considerations:

- **Option A** is correct as an electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
- **Option B** is incorrect because a neutral conductor cannot acquire a net charge through induction alone; it can only rearrange its charges.
- **Option C** is correct in that there will be an electrostatic attraction between the spheres due to the induced charges on the conducting sphere.
- **Option D** is incorrect as repulsion would not occur under these conditions.

Therefore, the most accurate answers are:

(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",0.0,"Analyze each option carefully, apply relevant principles or calculations, and select the most accurate answer.",2
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To find the minimum positive number of days after which planets X, Y, and Z will be aligned again in their initial positions relative to each other and the sun, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of their orbital periods. The orbital periods are 360 days for planet X, 450 days for planet Y, and 540 days for planet Z.

The LCM of several numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of each of the numbers. To find the LCM, we can use their prime factorizations:

- \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
- \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
- \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in these factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \(2^3\).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^3\).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 = 8 \times 27 \times 25 = 5400. \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.

The correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,"Analyze each option carefully, apply relevant principles or calculations, and select the most accurate answer.",2
