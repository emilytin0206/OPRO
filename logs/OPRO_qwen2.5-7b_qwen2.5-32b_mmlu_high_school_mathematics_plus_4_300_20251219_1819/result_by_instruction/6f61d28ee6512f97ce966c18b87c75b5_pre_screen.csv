"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the given scenario.

1. **Induced Electric Field (Option A):**
   - When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere. This is because the presence of the charged nonconducting sphere will cause charges in the conducting sphere to rearrange themselves due to electrostatic induction.

2. **Net Electric Charge on the Conducting Sphere (Option B):**
   - A neutral conducting sphere does not have a net charge, and when brought close to another charged object, it will redistribute its charges but will not develop a net charge of –Q or +Q. Instead, it will induce an equal amount of opposite charge near the side facing the nonconducting sphere and an equal amount of like charge on the far side.

3. **Electrostatic Forces (Options C & D):**
   - The electrostatic force between two charged objects is given by Coulomb's law: \( F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \), where \(k\) is Coulomb’s constant, \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) are the charges of the spheres, and \(r\) is the distance between them.
   - Since one sphere has a net positive charge +Q and the other will have an induced negative charge on its side facing the nonconducting sphere (let's call this –q), there will be an attractive force between these two regions. However, the conducting sphere as a whole remains electrically neutral in terms of net charge.

Given the above analysis:

- Option A is correct because an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere.
- Option B is incorrect because the conducting sphere does not develop a net charge; it redistributes charges but maintains electrical neutrality overall.
- Options C and D are related to the forces between the charged regions, but since the conducting sphere as a whole remains neutral, there can't be an overall repulsion or attraction based on the net charges.

Therefore, the most precise answer is:

**(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**",0.0,"Analyze the given information comprehensively, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer from those provided.",18
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

So, we need to solve:

\[ (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \]

To find the intervals where this inequality holds true, we determine the roots of the equation \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

Next, we test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the inequality \( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \) is satisfied in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero, we exclude the points where the expression under the square root equals zero, which are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \). Therefore, the domain of the function is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ E = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( E \) is the energy (work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ E = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

Calculate step by step:
\[ E = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]
\[ E = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]
\[ E = 5 \times 10^{-2} J \]

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider relevant legal principles, particularly those related to declaratory judgment actions and the standards for obtaining such relief. The key points from Supreme Court precedent that apply here include:

1. **Rooker-Feldman Doctrine**: This doctrine generally prevents federal district courts from hearing cases that are in essence appeals of state court judgments or that seek to review pending state court proceedings.

2. **Declaratory Judgment Act (DJA)**: The DJA, 28 U.S.C. § 2201-2202, allows a person ""to have determined any question of construction of an act of Congress or the validity of an act of an administrative agency under federal law"" and to obtain a declaration of rights.

3. **Standing**: A plaintiff must show that they have suffered or are imminently threatened with injury for which declaratory relief is sought.

4. **Mootness**: An issue becomes moot if it cannot be resolved by the court's decision, often due to changes in circumstances.

Given these principles:

- The law student has not been directly arrested and does not face an immediate threat of arrest based on his actions at the mall.
- His companions have already faced criminal charges for trespassing and loitering, but this is a separate matter from the declaratory judgment action he seeks to file.
- The federal district court would likely consider whether there is a genuine threat of enforcement against the law student before granting declaratory relief.

Analyzing each option:

(A) **Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**
   - This option suggests that the federal court should dismiss the action because it interferes with ongoing state proceedings. However, this is not a standard reason for dismissing a declaratory judgment action under DJA principles.

(B) **No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.**
   - This option is incorrect as it does not consider the specific circumstances and threats faced by the law student.

(C) **No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**
   - This option correctly identifies that the law student has shown a credible threat based on the actions taken against his friends and the previous warnings from the police. However, it does not address whether this is sufficient for declaratory relief.

(D) **Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.**
   - This option correctly identifies that the law student’s fears are speculative and do not meet the threshold required to obtain declaratory relief under DJA principles. The law student must show an immediate or imminent threat, which he has not demonstrated.

Therefore, the most precise answer is:

**D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.**

This conclusion aligns with the legal standards for obtaining declaratory relief and the need to show an immediate or imminent threat of enforcement.",0.0,"Analyze the given information comprehensively, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer from those provided.",18
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

\[ 2^3 = 8 \]
\[ 3^3 = 27 \]
\[ 5^2 = 25 \]

Multiplying these together:
\[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
\[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.
