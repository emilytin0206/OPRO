"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedents and the specific circumstances presented.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that determines the rights or obligations between parties without ordering any action other than a declaration. The primary purpose is to resolve legal disputes before they lead to actual harm.

2. **Supreme Court Precedents on Declaratory Judgments**:
   - In *Warth v. Seldin* (1975), the Supreme Court established that for a declaratory judgment action, there must be an ""actual controversy"" between the parties.
   - In *Lesar v. Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co.* of Chicago (1982), the Court further clarified that a plaintiff seeking a declaratory judgment must show a genuine threat of enforcement against them.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: This option suggests dismissing the action due to interference with existing state prosecutions, citing equity and comity. However, this is not directly relevant as there are no ongoing state prosecutions against the law student.
   - **Option B**: This option states that a federal plaintiff may seek declaratory judgment regardless of whether they are threatened by a state prosecution. While technically correct in general terms, it does not address the specific circumstances where an actual threat exists.
   - **Option C**: This option correctly identifies that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on the arrest of his companions and prior warnings. This aligns with *Lesar v. Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co.* which requires a showing of a genuine threat to justify a declaratory judgment.
   - **Option D**: This option suggests dismissing the action as premature because the law student's fears are speculative. However, given that his companions were arrested for similar actions, this fear is not entirely speculative.

Given these considerations, the most precise answer based on Supreme Court precedent and the specific circumstances provided is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly identifies that the law student has demonstrated an actual controversy through the actions taken against his friends and the previous warnings from the police.",1.0,"Analyze the question or context thoroughly, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically based on provided information, and select the most precise answer from those available.",8
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

So, we need to solve:

\[ (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \]

To find the intervals where this inequality holds true, we determine the roots of the equation \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

Next, we test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied:

- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the inequality \( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \) is satisfied in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

Therefore, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

So, the correct answer is:

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the given scenario.

1. **Nonconducting Sphere with +Q Charge**: This sphere has a net positive charge of +Q. When brought close to another object (in this case, a neutral conducting sphere), it will induce charges on the surface of the conducting sphere due to the electric field created by the nonconducting sphere.

2. **Conducting Sphere Initially Neutral**: A conducting sphere initially has no net charge. However, when placed in an electric field, free electrons within the conductor can move and rearrange themselves to counteract the external field as much as possible.

3. **Induced Charges on Conducting Sphere**:
   - When a positive charge is brought close to one side of a neutral conducting sphere, the electrons in the conductor will be repelled by the positive charge and move towards the opposite side.
   - This movement of charges results in an induced negative charge on the side closest to the nonconducting sphere with +Q and an induced positive charge on the far side.

4. **Electrostatic Forces**:
   - The induced negative charge on the side of the conducting sphere nearest to the nonconducting sphere will experience a repulsive force from the +Q charge.
   - However, the overall effect is that there will be an attractive electrostatic force between the two spheres due to the redistribution of charges.

Now let's evaluate each option:

(A) **An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
   - This statement is true because when a nonconducting sphere with +Q charge approaches, it creates an electric field that induces charges on the surface of the conducting sphere.

(B) **The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
   - This is incorrect because while there will be an induced negative charge on one side and positive on the other, these charges are not equal in magnitude to +Q; they only partially cancel out the external field but do not result in a net charge of –Q.

(C) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
   - This is correct because the induced negative charge on the side closest to the nonconducting sphere with +Q will attract it, resulting in an overall attractive force between the two spheres.

(D) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
   - This is incorrect because as explained above, the forces involved result in attraction rather than repulsion.

Therefore, based on the analysis and principles of electrostatics, the correct answer is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",0.0,"Analyze the question or context thoroughly, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically based on provided information, and select the most precise answer from those available.",8
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the numbers without any remainder.

The given orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

To find the LCM, we can use their prime factorizations:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Finding the LCM**:
   The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in these factorizations.
   - For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Therefore, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Calculating this product step-by-step:
- First, calculate \(2^3\):
  \[ 2^3 = 8 \]
- Next, calculate \(3^3\):
  \[ 3^3 = 27 \]
- Then, calculate \(5^2\):
  \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

Now multiply these together:
\[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
\[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Thus, the least common multiple of 360, 450, and 540 is 5400.

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:
\[ \boxed{5400} \]

So, the correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,"Analyze the question or context thoroughly, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically based on provided information, and select the most precise answer from those available.",8
