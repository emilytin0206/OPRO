"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the given scenario.

1. **Induced Electric Field (Option A):**
   - When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere. This is because the presence of the charged nonconducting sphere will cause charges in the conducting sphere to rearrange themselves due to electrostatic induction.

2. **Net Electric Charge on the Conducting Sphere (Option B):**
   - A neutral conducting sphere does not have a net charge, and when brought close to another charged object, it will redistribute its charges but will not acquire a net charge of –Q or +Q. Instead, it will develop induced charges that are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign on the side closest to the nonconducting sphere.

3. **Electrostatic Forces (Options C and D):**
   - The electrostatic force between two charged objects depends on their charges and the distance between them. Since the conducting sphere initially has no net charge, it will not have a net charge of –Q or +Q due to induction alone.
   - However, because the nonconducting sphere is positively charged (+Q), the side of the conducting sphere closest to it will develop an induced negative charge (due to electrons moving towards that side). This creates an attractive force between the two spheres.

Given these points:

- Option A is correct in stating that an electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
- Option B is incorrect because a neutral conductor cannot acquire a net charge through induction alone; it can only rearrange its charges.
- Options C and D are related to the nature of the force between the spheres, but since the conducting sphere develops an induced negative charge on the side closest to the nonconducting sphere, there will be an attractive electrostatic force.

Therefore, based on the principles of electrostatic induction and the resulting forces:

The most accurate answer is (C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",1.0,"Analyze the problem details carefully, use relevant principles or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and choose the most accurate answer based on the provided information.",4
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the situation based on relevant legal principles, particularly focusing on the Declaratory Judgment Act and Supreme Court precedents.

1. **Understanding the Declaratory Judgment Act**: The Declaratory Judgment Act allows a person ""to have determined any actual controversy"" regarding their rights or obligations under federal law. However, it does not provide a means to avoid prosecution for alleged violations of state laws unless there is an immediate and clear threat of enforcement.

2. **Supreme Court Precedents on Declaratory Judgments**: The Supreme Court has established that declaratory judgments should be granted only when the plaintiff can show a genuine threat of enforcement against them, not just speculative fears. This principle is derived from cases like *Warth v. Seldin* (1975), where the Court emphasized that there must be an ""actual controversy"" and a ""real and immediate"" threat to justify issuing declaratory relief.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: This option suggests dismissing the action because it would interfere with existing state prosecutions, citing equity and comity. While this is a valid concern in some contexts, it does not directly address whether there's an actual controversy or immediate threat.
   - **Option B**: This option states that a federal plaintiff may seek declaratory judgment even if not threatened by a state prosecution on the statute. However, this overlooks the requirement of showing a genuine threat to justify such relief.
   - **Option C**: This option correctly identifies that the law student can show a genuine threat due to his companions' arrest and prior warnings. This aligns with the Supreme Court's requirement for an actual controversy or immediate threat.
   - **Option D**: This option suggests dismissing the action as premature because of speculative fears, which is not entirely accurate since there are concrete threats against the law student’s friends.

Given these considerations, the most accurate answer based on the provided information and legal principles is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly identifies that there is an actual controversy and a real and immediate threat to justify seeking declaratory relief in federal court.",1.0,"Analyze the problem details carefully, use relevant principles or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and choose the most accurate answer based on the provided information.",4
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

So, we need to solve:

\[ (x-4)(x+1) > 0 \]

To find where this inequality holds true, we determine the roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

Next, we test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

From this analysis, we see that the inequality \( (x-4)(x+1) > 0 \) holds in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

Therefore, the domain of the function is:

\[ x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:
