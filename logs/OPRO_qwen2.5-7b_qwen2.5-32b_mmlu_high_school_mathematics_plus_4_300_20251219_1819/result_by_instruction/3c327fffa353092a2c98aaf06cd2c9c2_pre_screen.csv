"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedents and the specific circumstances presented.

### Analysis:

1. **Nature of Declaratory Judgment Action**: A declaratory judgment is a lawsuit brought by one party seeking a court's determination on the rights, status, or other legal relations of the parties without any actual controversy as to which there could be a concrete dispute. The primary purpose is to clarify the legal situation and avoid future disputes.

2. **Supreme Court Precedents**: The key Supreme Court case here is *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club*, 451 U.S. 287 (1981). In this case, the Court held that a declaratory judgment action could be dismissed if it would interfere with ongoing state prosecutions or would otherwise disrupt the normal course of judicial proceedings.

3. **Applying the Precedent**:
   - The law student is seeking an advance ruling on the constitutionality of criminal statutes.
   - His companions have already been arrested for criminal trespass and loitering, indicating that there is a genuine threat of enforcement against him as well.
   - However, the question asks whether the federal district court will dismiss the declaratory judgment action based on Supreme Court precedent.

### Evaluating Each Option:

- **Option (A)**: This option suggests that the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and thus be disallowed. While this is a valid concern, it does not fully capture the essence of the Supreme Court's decision in *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club*.
  
- **Option (B)**: This option states that a federal plaintiff may seek declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute. However, this overlooks the specific circumstances where there is a genuine threat of enforcement.

- **Option (C)**: This option correctly identifies that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on the arrest of his companions and prior warnings. The Supreme Court's decision in *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club* does not preclude such an action if there is a clear and present danger.

- **Option (D)**: This option suggests that the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student’s fears of future arrest are speculative. However, given the concrete threat evidenced by his companions' arrests, this argument is less compelling.

### Conclusion:

The most precise answer based on Supreme Court precedent and the specific circumstances provided is **(C)**: No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.",0.0,"Analyze the question in detail, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on given information, and select the most precise answer from those provided.",16
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's break down the scenario and apply relevant principles from electrostatics.

### Scenario Analysis:
- We have a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge \(+Q\).
- This nonconducting sphere is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Induced Charges in Conductors**: When a charged object (in this case, the nonconducting sphere) approaches a conductor, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. The side of the conductor closest to the charge will develop an induced negative charge, and the far side will develop an induced positive charge.
2. **Electrostatic Forces**: Opposite charges attract each other, while like charges repel.

### Applying the Concepts:
- When the nonconducting sphere with a net \(+Q\) is brought close to the neutral conducting sphere, the electrons in the conductor are free to move and will be attracted towards the side of the conductor closest to the positive charge. This results in an induced negative charge on that side.
- Consequently, the far side of the conducting sphere will have an induced positive charge.

### Evaluating Each Option:
(A) **An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere**.
   - Incorrect: The electric field inside a conductor is zero when it is in electrostatic equilibrium. Induced charges on the surface create an external electric field, but not an internal one.

(B) **The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q**.
   - Incorrect: The total charge of the system must be conserved. Since no charge was added to the neutral conductor and only induced charges are present, the net charge on the conductor remains zero.

(C) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction**.
   - Correct: The side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere will have a negative charge, which attracts the positive charge \(+Q\) from the nonconducting sphere. This results in an attractive force between the two spheres.

(D) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion**.
   - Incorrect: As explained above, there is an attraction due to the induced charges on the conducting sphere.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and application of relevant principles from electrostatics, the correct answer is:

**(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**",0.0,"Analyze the question in detail, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on given information, and select the most precise answer from those provided.",16
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

### Step 1: Factorize the quadratic expression
The quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0 \) can be factored as:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

### Step 2: Determine where the factors are zero
Set each factor to zero to find the critical points:
\[ x - 4 = 0 \implies x = 4 \]
\[ x + 1 = 0 \implies x = -1 \]

These points divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 3: Test each interval
We need to determine where the product \((x-4)(x+1)\) is positive. We can test a point in each interval:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \), choose \( x = -2 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]

- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \), choose \( x = 0 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \), choose \( x = 5 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

### Step 4: Combine the results
The expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is satisfied in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 5: Consider the denominator
Since the function includes a square root in the denominator, we must ensure that the expression under the square root is strictly greater than zero. Therefore, we exclude the points where it equals zero:
\[ x = -1 \text{ and } x = 4 \]

Thus, the domain of \( f(x) \) is the union of the intervals where the expression inside the square root is positive:
\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

### Conclusion
The correct answer is:

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Identify the Highest Powers of Each Prime**:
   - For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

3. **Calculate LCM**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2
   \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     - \(2^3 = 8\)
     - \(3^3 = 27\)
     - \(5^2 = 25\)

4. **Multiply the Results**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 8 \times 27 \times 25
   \]
   - First, multiply 8 and 27:
     \[
     8 \times 27 = 216
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by 25:
     \[
     216 \times 25 = 5400
     \]

Thus, the least common multiple of 360, 450, and 540 is 5400.

### Conclusion:

The minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,"Analyze the question in detail, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on given information, and select the most precise answer from those provided.",16
