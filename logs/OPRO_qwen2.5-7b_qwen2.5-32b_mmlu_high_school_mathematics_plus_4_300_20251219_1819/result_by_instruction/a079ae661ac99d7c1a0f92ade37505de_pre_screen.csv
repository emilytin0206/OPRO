"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, determine where this product is greater than zero. The roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \) are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero and we have already ensured that it is non-zero in these intervals, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To solve this problem, let's analyze each option based on the principles of electrostatics and the behavior of conductors in the presence of charges.

1. **Option (A): An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
   - When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, an electric field is indeed induced within the conducting sphere due to the influence of the external charge. This induced electric field causes charges in the conductor to rearrange themselves.

2. **Option (B): The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
   - In a conductor, charges can move freely and will redistribute themselves such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. For a neutral conductor brought close to a positively charged object, positive charges on the side facing the nonconducting sphere will be attracted towards it, while negative charges will be pushed away from this side. However, the total charge of the conducting sphere remains zero because any excess positive charge on one side is balanced by an equal amount of induced negative charge on the opposite side.

3. **Option (C): The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
   - Since the nonconducting sphere has a net positive charge +Q and the conducting sphere initially had no net charge, there will be an attractive force between them due to the induced charges in the conductor. Positive charges on the side of the conducting sphere facing the nonconducting sphere are attracted towards it.

4. **Option (D): The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
   - This is incorrect because the net charge on the conducting sphere remains zero, and there's no overall positive or negative charge that would cause a repulsive force between them.

Based on this analysis:

- Option (A) is correct as an electric field is induced within the conducting sphere.
- Option (B) is incorrect since the total charge of the conducting sphere does not change to –Q; it redistributes but remains neutral overall.
- Option (C) is correct in terms of the force experienced, which would be attractive due to the induced charges.
- Option (D) is incorrect as there will be no repulsion.

Given that both options (A) and (C) are true based on our analysis, but we need to select the most accurate answer from those provided:

The correct answer is **(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**",1.0,"Analyze the problem context carefully, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on logical reasoning, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",12
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 0.005 J.",0.0,"Analyze the problem context carefully, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on logical reasoning, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",12
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedents and the specific circumstances presented.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that determines the rights of parties without ordering any action or providing relief. The primary purpose is to resolve legal disputes before they lead to more serious consequences.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent**: In cases such as *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club* (1970), the Supreme Court established that a declaratory judgment can be granted even if there is no immediate threat of prosecution, provided that the plaintiff has a genuine and substantial interest in the matter.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: This suggests that the federal district court would dismiss the action because it interferes with existing state prosecutions. However, this reasoning does not align well with the Supreme Court's stance on declaratory judgments.
   - **Option B**: This option states that a plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if they are not directly threatened by prosecution. While this is generally true, it doesn't fully address the specific circumstances of the law student’s case.
   - **Option C**: This suggests that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings. This aligns well with the Supreme Court's recognition of declaratory relief in cases where there is a substantial risk of future enforcement.
   - **Option D**: This option argues that the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student’s fears are speculative. However, given the concrete actions taken against his companions and the warnings received, this argument seems less compelling.

4. **Conclusion Based on Supreme Court Precedent**:
Given the circumstances where the law student has a clear and substantial interest in avoiding future enforcement of criminal statutes due to prior warnings and arrests of his friends, the most accurate answer is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly applies the legal principles that allow for declaratory relief when there is a substantial risk of future enforcement actions.",1.0,"Analyze the problem context carefully, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on logical reasoning, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",12
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

\[
2^3 = 8
\]
\[
3^3 = 27
\]
\[
5^2 = 25
\]

Multiplying these together:
\[
8 \times 27 = 216
\]
\[
216 \times 25 = 5400
\]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.
