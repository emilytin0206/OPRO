"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, determine where this product is greater than zero. The roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \) are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero and we have already ensured that it is positive in these intervals, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved:

1. **Induced Electric Field in Conductors**: When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, the charges within the conducting sphere will rearrange themselves due to the influence of the external electric field created by the nonconducting sphere.

2. **Charge Induction on Conductors**: In a conductor, free electrons can move freely and will be influenced by an external electric field. The side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere with +Q charge will experience a higher electric field strength compared to the opposite side. This causes the free electrons in the conducting sphere to move towards the far side from the nonconducting sphere, leaving behind a net positive charge on the near side and a net negative charge on the far side.

3. **Electrostatic Forces**: The electrostatic force between two charges is given by Coulomb's law: \( F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \), where \(k\) is Coulomb’s constant, \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) are the magnitudes of the charges, and \(r\) is the distance between them. Since one sphere has a net positive charge (+Q) and the other has an induced negative charge (–Q), they will experience an electrostatic attraction.

Now let's evaluate each option:

(A) **An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere**.
- This statement is true because the charges in the conducting sphere will rearrange themselves due to the influence of the external electric field from the nonconducting sphere. However, this alone does not fully describe what happens next.

(B) **The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q**.
- This statement is incorrect. The conducting sphere will have an induced charge distribution but no overall net charge because the charges are redistributed within the conductor and do not leave it. The total charge remains zero due to conservation of charge.

(C) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction**.
- This statement is true based on Coulomb's law, as a positive charge (+Q) will attract a negative charge (–Q).

(D) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion**.
- This statement is incorrect because the charges are of opposite signs and thus will attract each other.

Given these analyses, the most accurate answer is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",0.0,"Analyze the problem carefully, apply relevant principles or calculations when necessary, eliminate incorrect options, and select the most accurate answer based on the given information.",17
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.1 \]
\[ U = 0.05 \, \text{J} \]

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the situation based on relevant legal principles, particularly focusing on the Declaratory Judgment Act and Supreme Court precedents.

The key points from the scenario include:
- The law student's companions were arrested for criminal trespass and loitering after continuing their protest despite warnings.
- The law student filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, specifically to avoid being arrested himself.

Let’s evaluate each option:

(A) **Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**
- This option suggests that a federal court should not issue declaratory relief if it might interfere with ongoing state proceedings. However, the Supreme Court has generally allowed declaratory judgments to prevent future harm, even when there is an ongoing prosecution.

(B) **No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.**
- This option is incorrect because it does not consider the specific circumstances of the case where the law student's companions were arrested and he fears similar treatment.

(C) **No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**
- This option aligns with Supreme Court precedent that supports declaratory judgments when there is a ""genuine"" or ""real and immediate"" threat of enforcement. The arrests of his friends and the warnings from the police provide evidence of such a threat.

(D) **Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.**
- This option suggests that the law student’s fears are too hypothetical to justify a declaratory judgment. However, the Supreme Court has recognized that declaratory judgments can be granted even if there is no immediate threat but a genuine and imminent danger.

Given these considerations, the most accurate answer based on Supreme Court precedent is:

**C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly identifies that the law student has a legitimate basis for seeking declaratory relief due to the real and immediate threat posed by the criminal statutes.",0.0,"Analyze the problem carefully, apply relevant principles or calculations when necessary, eliminate incorrect options, and select the most accurate answer based on the given information.",17
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM will give us the minimum number of days after which all three planets will be in their initial positions relative to each other again.

The given orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorizations of these numbers:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:
