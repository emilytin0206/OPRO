"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 0.005 J.",0.0,"Analyze the question thoroughly, apply relevant principles or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically based on provided information, and select the most accurate answer.",8
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the scenario described.

1. **Induced Electric Field (Option A):**
   - When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere. This is because the presence of the charged sphere will cause charges in the conducting sphere to rearrange themselves due to electrostatic forces.

2. **Net Electric Charge on the Conducting Sphere (Option B):**
   - A neutral conducting sphere does not have a net charge, and when brought close to another charged object, it will redistribute its charges but will not acquire a net charge of –Q or +Q. Instead, it will develop induced charges that balance out any external influence.

3. **Electrostatic Forces (Options C & D):**
   - The key principle here is the interaction between charges. A positive charge (+Q) will attract negative charges and repel positive charges. Therefore, when the charged nonconducting sphere approaches the neutral conducting sphere, it will induce a separation of charges within the conducting sphere.
     - Positive charges in the conducting sphere will be pushed to one side (away from the +Q), while an equal amount of negative charges will be pulled to the other side (towards the +Q).
   - This redistribution results in an overall electrostatic attraction between the two spheres. The positive charge on the nonconducting sphere attracts the induced negative charges on the conducting sphere, leading to a net attractive force.

Given this analysis:

- Option A is correct but not the most specific answer.
- Option B is incorrect because the neutral conducting sphere will not acquire a net charge of –Q or +Q; it will just rearrange its existing charges.
- Options C and D are both related to electrostatic forces, but since the induced charges on the conducting sphere will be such that they attract the nonconducting sphere, the correct answer is:

**The most accurate answer is (C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**

This conclusion is based on the fundamental principles of electrostatics and the behavior of charges in conductors under external influences.",1.0,"Analyze the question thoroughly, apply relevant principles or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically based on provided information, and select the most accurate answer.",8
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

So, we need to solve:

\[ (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \]

To find the intervals where this inequality holds true, we determine the roots of the equation \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

Next, we test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the inequality \( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \) is satisfied in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero, we exclude the points where the expression under the square root equals zero, which are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \). Therefore, the domain of the function is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider principles from constitutional law, specifically related to declaratory judgment actions and the balance between federal and state interests.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a legal remedy that allows a court to declare the rights of parties without ordering any specific action or awarding damages. The primary purpose is to resolve legal uncertainties before they lead to actual disputes.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent and Federalism**: The Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of federalism, which involves respecting state sovereignty while ensuring that federal courts can provide necessary relief when there are genuine threats of enforcement against individuals.

3. **Equity and Comity**: Courts often consider equity (fairness) and comity (respect for other jurisdictions' laws) in deciding whether to grant declaratory relief. However, these considerations do not necessarily preclude a court from granting relief if the plaintiff can show a genuine threat of enforcement.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: This suggests that the federal district court would dismiss the action because it interferes with existing state prosecutions. While this is a valid concern, Supreme Court precedent has generally allowed for declaratory judgments even when there are ongoing state proceedings, provided there is a genuine threat.
   - **Option B**: This option states that a plaintiff may seek declaratory relief regardless of whether they are threatened by a state prosecution. However, the Supreme Court has recognized that federal courts should not issue advisory opinions and must have a case or controversy before them.
   - **Option C**: This suggests that the law student can show a genuine threat based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings. The Supreme Court has allowed declaratory judgments when there is a clear and present danger of enforcement, which seems to align with this scenario.
   - **Option D**: This option argues that the relief would be premature because the law student's fears are speculative. While it’s true that future threats can sometimes be speculative, the Supreme Court has recognized that a genuine threat of enforcement can justify a declaratory judgment.

Given these considerations and applying relevant principles from constitutional law:

**The most accurate answer is (C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly identifies that the Supreme Court has allowed for declaratory judgments when there is a clear and present danger of enforcement, which is supported by the evidence in this case.",1.0,"Analyze the question thoroughly, apply relevant principles or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically based on provided information, and select the most accurate answer.",8
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.
