"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 0.005 J.",0.0,"Analyze the problem context thoroughly, apply relevant principles or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically based on provided information, and select the most precise answer from those available.",7
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, determine where this product is greater than zero. The roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \) are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero and we have already ensured that it is positive in these intervals, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the given scenario.

1. **Nonconducting Sphere with +Q Charge**: This sphere has a net positive charge of +Q. When brought close to another object (in this case, a neutral conducting sphere), it will induce charges on the surface of the conducting sphere due to the electric field created by the nonconducting sphere.

2. **Neutral Conducting Sphere**: A conductor distributes its charge such that the electric field inside is zero. This means any external electric field will cause the free electrons in the conductor to move and rearrange themselves until they cancel out the external field within the conductor.

3. **Induced Charges on the Conducting Sphere**:
   - When a positive charge (+Q) approaches, it repels the free electrons in the conducting sphere towards one side of the sphere.
   - This leaves the other side with an excess of protons (positive charges), creating a net negative charge on that side.

4. **Electrostatic Forces Between Spheres**:
   - The induced positive charge on the side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere will attract the +Q charge.
   - However, due to the overall neutral nature and the distribution of charges, there is no net repulsion or attraction between the spheres based solely on their induced charges.

Now let's evaluate each option:

(A) **An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
- This statement is true because when a nonconducting charged object approaches a conductor, it induces an electric field and rearranges the free electrons in the conductor.

(B) **The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
- This is incorrect. The conducting sphere does not gain or lose any net charge; instead, it redistributes its charges to maintain electrical neutrality overall but with induced charges on its surface.

(C) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
- While there might be local attractive forces due to the induced charges, the overall interaction between a positively charged nonconducting sphere and a neutral conducting sphere does not result in net attraction because of the conductor's ability to maintain electrical neutrality.

(D) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
- This is also incorrect for the same reason as (C). There is no net repulsive force due to the induced charges since the overall charge distribution on the conducting sphere remains neutral.

Given these considerations, the most precise answer based on the principles of electrostatics and the behavior of conductors in an electric field is:

(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.",0.0,"Analyze the problem context thoroughly, apply relevant principles or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically based on provided information, and select the most precise answer from those available.",7
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider principles from constitutional law, specifically related to declaratory judgment actions and the balance between federal and state interests.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a legal remedy that allows a court to declare the rights of parties without ordering any specific action or awarding damages. The primary purpose is to resolve legal disputes before they lead to more serious consequences, such as criminal prosecution.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent and Declaratory Judgments**: In cases like *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club* (1970), the Supreme Court established that federal courts can issue declaratory judgments even if there is no immediate threat of enforcement against the plaintiff, provided the case involves a genuine legal controversy.

3. **Equity and Comity**: The principle of equity and comity suggests that federal courts should avoid interfering with ongoing state prosecutions unless absolutely necessary to prevent irreparable harm or to clarify constitutional rights. However, this does not mean that declaratory judgments are never granted in such circumstances; it means the court must carefully weigh the potential for interference.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: This option suggests dismissing the action due to interference with state prosecutions. While this is a valid concern, Supreme Court precedent allows for declaratory relief even when there's no immediate threat if the case involves a genuine legal controversy.
   - **Option B**: This option states that a federal plaintiff can seek declaratory judgment regardless of whether they are threatened by a state prosecution. However, it does not address the balance between federal and state interests.
   - **Option C**: This option correctly identifies that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings. This aligns with Supreme Court precedent allowing declaratory relief in such circumstances.
   - **Option D**: This option suggests dismissing the action as premature because the fears are speculative. However, the existence of prior warnings and arrests provides a basis for a genuine legal controversy.

Given these considerations, the most precise answer is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the numbers without any remainder.

The given orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.

The correct answer is:
