"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.1 \]
\[ U = 0.05 \, \text{J} \]

Therefore, the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V is:

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's break down the scenario and apply relevant principles from electrostatics.

1. **Initial Setup**: We have a nonconducting sphere with a net electric charge +Q and a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius.

2. **Induced Charges in Conductors**:
   - When a charged object (in this case, the nonconducting sphere) is brought close to a conductor, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. The side of the conductor closest to the charge will develop an induced negative charge, and the far side will develop an induced positive charge.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - (A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
     - This is not accurate because in a conductor, charges can only move on the surface; there are no free charges inside the conductor to create an internal electric field.
   
   - (B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
     - This is incorrect. While the side closest to the nonconducting sphere will have an induced negative charge, this does not mean the entire sphere will acquire a net charge of –Q. Instead, it will be partially charged with opposite signs on different parts of its surface.

   - (C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
     - This is correct because the nonconducting sphere has a positive charge +Q, and the induced negative charge on the side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere will create an attractive force between them. According to Coulomb's law, opposite charges attract.

   - (D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.
     - This is incorrect because there are no like charges that would cause a repulsive force in this scenario. The only significant charge interaction here is the attraction due to opposite charges.

4. **Conclusion**:
The most accurate answer based on the principles of electrostatics and induced charges in conductors is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",0.0,"Analyze the question in depth, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on the provided information, and select the most accurate answer from those given.",19
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider relevant legal principles, particularly those related to declaratory judgment actions and their application in federal courts. The key points from Supreme Court precedent that will guide our analysis include the standards for granting declaratory relief and the factors that may lead a court to dismiss such an action.

1. **Standard for Declaratory Judgment**: Under 28 U.S.C. § 2201, a federal district court has the authority to declare rights, status, or other legal relations of any interested party. However, this power is not absolute and can be limited by considerations of equity and comity.

2. **Equity and Comity**: Courts may refuse to grant declaratory relief if it would interfere with ongoing state prosecutions or if there are significant concerns about the propriety of such an action in light of existing legal proceedings.

3. **Mootness and Ripeness**: A case is considered moot when the issue has been resolved, and ripeness requires that the controversy be sufficiently concrete to warrant judicial resolution.

Given these principles:

- **Option (A)** suggests that declaratory relief would interfere with state prosecutions due to equity and comity considerations. This could be a valid reason for dismissal if the federal court believes its action might disrupt ongoing legal proceedings.
  
- **Option (B)** states that a plaintiff may seek declaratory judgment even without being threatened by a state prosecution, which is generally true but does not address the specific circumstances of this case.

- **Option (C)** indicates that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings. This could support the argument for granting declaratory relief if the court finds that there is a real and immediate danger to the plaintiff.

- **Option (D)** argues that the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears are speculative, which might apply if the court determines that no concrete threat exists or has not materialized yet.

Considering Supreme Court precedent, particularly cases like *Warth v. Seldin* and *Baker v. Carr*, which emphasize the need for a justiciable case or controversy, we can conclude:

- The law student's companions have already been arrested, creating a concrete threat of enforcement.
- The warnings issued by the police indicate an ongoing and imminent risk to the law student.

Therefore, **Option (C)** is the most accurate answer. It correctly identifies that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings, which would support the granting of declaratory relief.

**Final Answer: (C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**",1.0,"Analyze the question in depth, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on the provided information, and select the most accurate answer from those given.",19
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

### Step 1: Factorize the quadratic expression
First, we factorize the quadratic equation:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

### Step 2: Determine where the factors are zero
Set each factor to zero to find the critical points:
\[ x - 4 = 0 \implies x = 4 \]
\[ x + 1 = 0 \implies x = -1 \]

These points divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 3: Test each interval
We need to determine where the product \((x-4)(x+1)\) is positive. We can test a point in each interval:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \), choose \( x = -2 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]

- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \), choose \( x = 0 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \), choose \( x = 5 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

### Step 4: Combine the results
The expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \) is positive in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 5: Consider the denominator
Since the function includes a square root in the denominator, we must ensure that the expression inside the square root is strictly greater than zero. Therefore, we exclude the points where it equals zero:
\[ x = -1 \text{ and } x = 4 \]

Thus, the domain of \( f(x) \) is the union of the intervals where the expression is positive:
\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

### Conclusion
The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{(C) (-\infty, -1) U (4, \infty)} \]",1.0,"Analyze the question in depth, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on the provided information, and select the most accurate answer from those given.",19
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Identify the Highest Powers of Each Prime**:
   - For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

3. **Calculate LCM**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2
   \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     - \(2^3 = 8\)
     - \(3^3 = 27\)
     - \(5^2 = 25\)

4. **Multiply the Results**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 8 \times 27 \times 25
   \]
   - First, multiply 8 and 27:
     \[
     8 \times 27 = 216
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by 25:
     \[
     216 \times 25 = 5400
     \]

Thus, the least common multiple of 360, 450, and 540 is 5400.

### Conclusion:

The minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,"Analyze the question in depth, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on the provided information, and select the most accurate answer from those given.",19
