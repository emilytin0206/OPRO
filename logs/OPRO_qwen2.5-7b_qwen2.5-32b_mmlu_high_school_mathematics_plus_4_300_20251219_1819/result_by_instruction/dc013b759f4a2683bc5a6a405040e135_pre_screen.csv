"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's break down the scenario and apply relevant principles from electrostatics.

### Scenario Analysis:
- We have a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge \(+Q\).
- This nonconducting sphere is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Induced Charges in Conductors**: When a charged object (in this case, the nonconducting sphere) approaches a conductor, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. The side of the conductor closest to the charge will develop an induced negative charge, and the far side will develop an induced positive charge.
2. **Electrostatic Forces**: Opposite charges attract each other, while like charges repel.

### Applying the Concepts:
- When the nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge \(+Q\) is brought close to the neutral conducting sphere, the electrons in the conductor are free to move and will be attracted towards the side of the conductor closest to the nonconducting sphere. This movement results in an induced negative charge on that side.
- Consequently, the far side of the conducting sphere will have a net positive charge due to the redistribution of charges.

### Evaluating Each Option:
(A) **An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere**.
   - This is not accurate because the electric field inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is zero. The movement of charges on the surface does not create an internal electric field.

(B) **The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q**.
   - This is incorrect because the total charge of the system must be conserved. The nonconducting sphere still has \(+Q\), and the induced negative charge on one side of the conductor does not change this fact; it only redistributes charges.

(C) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction**.
   - This is correct because the induced negative charge on the closest part of the conducting sphere will attract the positive charge from the nonconducting sphere. The opposite charges (positive and negative) attract each other, leading to a net attractive force between the two spheres.

(D) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion**.
   - This is incorrect because there are no like charges on the same side of either sphere that would cause repulsion; instead, we have opposite charges attracting each other.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and application of relevant principles from electrostatics, the most accurate answer is:

**(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**",0.0,"Analyze the question in detail, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on the given information, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",16
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

So, we need to solve:

\[ (x-4)(x+1) > 0 \]

To find where this inequality holds true, we determine the roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These points divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied:

- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the inequality \( (x-4)(x+1) > 0 \) is satisfied in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

Next, we need to ensure that the denominator is not zero. The expression under the square root must be strictly greater than zero, so there are no additional restrictions from this part.

Therefore, combining these results, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedents and the specific circumstances presented.

### Analysis:

1. **Nature of Declaratory Judgment Action**: A declaratory judgment is a lawsuit brought by one party seeking a court's determination on the rights, status, or legal relations between parties without any actual controversy over which there are adverse legal interests. The primary purpose is to resolve doubts and clarify legal relationships.

2. **Supreme Court Precedents**:
   - **Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores (1980)**: This case established that a declaratory judgment action cannot be used as a substitute for an actual controversy, meaning the court will not issue a declaration if there is no real and immediate threat of enforcement.
   - **Warth v. Seldin (1975)**: The Court emphasized that to have standing to seek a declaratory judgment, a plaintiff must show a ""real and immediate"" threat of enforcement against them.

3. **Application to the Case**:
   - The law student is seeking a declaration on the constitutionality of criminal trespass and loitering statutes.
   - His companions were arrested for these offenses, but he has not been threatened with arrest himself (he left voluntarily).
   - The warnings issued by the police do not necessarily indicate an imminent threat to him; they could be general warnings.

### Evaluating Each Option:

- **Option A**: This option suggests that declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions. While this is a valid concern, it does not directly address whether there is a real and immediate threat to the law student.
  
- **Option B**: This option states that a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute. However, Supreme Court precedents like Blue Chip Stamps and Warth indicate that such relief should be granted only when there is an actual threat to the plaintiff.
  
- **Option C**: This option claims that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings. While these factors might suggest a potential future threat, they do not necessarily establish a ""real and immediate"" threat as required by Supreme Court precedents.
  
- **Option D**: This option states that declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are speculative. Given the Supreme Court's emphasis on real and immediate threats in cases like Blue Chip Stamps and Warth, this is likely the most accurate answer.

### Conclusion:

The correct answer is (D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part. This aligns with Supreme Court precedents that require a real and immediate threat for a declaratory judgment action to proceed.",0.0,"Analyze the question in detail, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on the given information, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",16
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers without any remainder.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Identify the Highest Powers of Each Prime**:
   - For \(2\): The highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\): The highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\): The highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

3. **Calculate the LCM**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2
   \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     - \(2^3 = 8\)
     - \(3^3 = 27\)
     - \(5^2 = 25\)

4. **Multiply the Results**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 8 \times 27 \times 25
   \]
   - First, multiply 8 and 27:
     \[
     8 \times 27 = 216
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by 25:
     \[
     216 \times 25 = 5400
     \]

Thus, the least common multiple of 360, 450, and 540 is 5400.

### Conclusion:

The minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,"Analyze the question in detail, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on the given information, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",16
