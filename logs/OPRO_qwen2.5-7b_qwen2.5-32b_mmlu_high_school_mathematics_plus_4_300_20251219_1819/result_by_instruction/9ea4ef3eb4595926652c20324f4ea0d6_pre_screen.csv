"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\( C \)) = 10 µF = \( 10 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F} \)
- Potential difference (\( V \)) = 100 V

Now we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F}) \times (100 \, \text{V})^2 \]

First, calculate \( V^2 \):

\[ V^2 = (100)^2 = 10000 \, \text{V}^2 \]

Next, substitute this value back into the equation:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{J} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{J} \]
\[ U = 0.005 \, \text{J} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedents and the specific circumstances presented.

### Analysis:

1. **Nature of Declaratory Judgment Action**: A declaratory judgment is a lawsuit brought by one party seeking a court's determination on the rights, status, or other legal relations of the parties without any actual controversy about an existing fact or transaction. The primary purpose is to resolve doubts and clarify legal relationships.

2. **Supreme Court Precedents**:
   - **Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores (1980)**: This case established that a declaratory judgment action cannot be used as a means of avoiding prosecution for criminal conduct.
   - **Bouie v. City of Columbia (1964)**: This case emphasized the importance of judicial review in ensuring that laws do not violate constitutional rights.

3. **Specific Circumstances**:
   - The law student has filed an action to get a declaratory judgment on the constitutionality of criminal statutes.
   - His companions have already been arrested for criminal trespass and loitering, indicating a real threat of enforcement against him as well.
   - He was warned by police twice before his companions were arrested.

### Evaluation of Options:

- **Option (A)**: This option suggests that declaratory relief would be disallowed due to interference with existing state prosecutions. While this is a valid concern, the Supreme Court has not uniformly dismissed such actions based solely on the existence of ongoing state proceedings.
  
- **Option (B)**: This option states that a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not directly threatened by a state prosecution. However, the Supreme Court's stance in Blue Chip Stamps suggests otherwise.

- **Option (C)**: This option argues that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings. This aligns with Bouie v. City of Columbia, which supports judicial review to ensure laws do not violate constitutional rights.
  
- **Option (D)**: This option claims that declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears are speculative. However, the existence of a genuine threat from his companions' arrest and prior warnings suggests otherwise.

### Conclusion:

Given the Supreme Court precedent in Bouie v. City of Columbia, which supports judicial review to ensure laws do not violate constitutional rights, and considering the real threat faced by the law student based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings, **Option (C)** is the most accurate answer.

**Final Answer: (C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**",1.0,"Analyze the problem context meticulously, apply relevant theories or calculations where necessary, critically evaluate each option, and select the most accurate answer based on the provided information.",11
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's break down each option and apply relevant principles from electrostatics.

### Given Information:
- A nonconducting sphere with a net electric charge \( +Q \).
- A neutral conducting sphere of the same radius as the nonconducting sphere.
- The nonconducting sphere is brought close to the conducting sphere.

### Analysis:

1. **Option (A): An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
   - When a charged object approaches a conductor, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. Specifically, the side of the conductor closest to the charge will develop an opposite charge, and the far side will develop a similar charge.
   - This is due to the redistribution of free electrons in the conductor under the influence of the external electric field created by the nonconducting sphere.

2. **Option (B): The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
   - A neutral conducting sphere cannot have a net charge; it can only redistribute charges on its surface due to the presence of an external charge.
   - Therefore, this option is incorrect because the total charge must remain zero in a conductor.

3. **Option (C): The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
   - An electric field from the nonconducting sphere will induce opposite charges on the conducting sphere, but these induced charges are not net charges.
   - The overall effect of this induction is that there will be an attractive force between the two spheres due to the interaction of their respective fields.

4. **Option (D): The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
   - This would only occur if both spheres had like charges, but since one sphere is neutral and the other has a net charge \( +Q \), there cannot be a direct repulsive force between them due to their net charges.

### Conclusion:
- The correct answer is (C) because an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere, leading to opposite charges on its surface. This results in an attractive electrostatic force between the two spheres.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided information and principles of electrostatics is:

"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

### Step 1: Factorize the quadratic expression
First, we factorize the quadratic equation:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

### Step 2: Determine where the factors are zero
Set each factor to zero and solve for \( x \):
\[ x - 4 = 0 \implies x = 4 \]
\[ x + 1 = 0 \implies x = -1 \]

These points, \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \), divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 3: Test each interval
We need to determine where the product \((x-4)(x+1)\) is positive. We can test a point in each interval:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \), choose \( x = -2 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]

- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \), choose \( x = 0 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \), choose \( x = 5 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

### Step 4: Combine the results
The expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \) is positive in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 5: Ensure the denominator is not zero
Since we need the square root to be defined and non-zero, we exclude the points where the expression equals zero:
\[ x = -1 \text{ and } x = 4 \]

Thus, the domain of \( f(x) \) is all real numbers in the intervals where the expression inside the square root is positive, excluding the points that make it zero.

### Final Answer
The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{(C) (-\infty, -1) U (4, \infty)}

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers without any remainder.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Identify the Highest Powers of Each Prime**:
   - For \(2\): The highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\): The highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\): The highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

3. **Calculate the LCM**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2
   \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     - \(2^3 = 8\)
     - \(3^3 = 27\)
     - \(5^2 = 25\)

4. **Multiply the Results**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 8 \times 27 \times 25
   \]
   - First, multiply 8 and 27:
     \[
     8 \times 27 = 216
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by 25:
     \[
     216 \times 25 = 5400
     \]

Thus, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.

The correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,"Analyze the problem context meticulously, apply relevant theories or calculations where necessary, critically evaluate each option, and select the most accurate answer based on the provided information.",11
