"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

So, we need to solve:

\[ (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \]

To find the intervals where this inequality holds true, we determine the roots of the equation \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

Next, we test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the inequality \( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \) is satisfied in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero, we exclude the points where the expression under the square root equals zero, which are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \). Therefore, the domain of the function is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (work required),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

Calculate step by step:
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{J} \]
\[ U = 0.05 \, \text{J} \]

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To analyze this scenario comprehensively, we need to consider several key elements:

1. **Nature of the Declaratory Judgment Action**: The law student is seeking a declaratory judgment regarding the constitutionality of criminal trespass and loitering statutes. This action aims to get an advance ruling on whether these laws are constitutional.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent**: The most relevant Supreme Court precedent here would be **Baker v. Carr (1962)**, which established that federal courts have the power to issue declaratory judgments when there is a ""case or controversy"" and the plaintiff has standing. Another important case is **Warth v. Seldin (1975)**, which outlined the requirements for standing in such cases.

3. **Standing Requirements**: For a declaratory judgment action, the plaintiff must show:
   - A real and immediate threat of enforcement against them.
   - That they have suffered or are immediately in danger of suffering some actual or threatened injury as a result of the statute's application to their conduct.

4. **Analysis of Options**:

- **Option (A)**: This option suggests that declaratory relief would be disallowed due to interference with existing state prosecutions, citing equity and comity. However, this is not directly supported by Supreme Court precedent on declaratory judgments.
  
- **Option (B)**: This option states that a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if they are not threatened with a state prosecution on the statute. This is incorrect because the law student must show a genuine threat of enforcement against them, as evidenced by his companions' arrest and prior warnings.

- **Option (C)**: This option correctly identifies that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement based on the arrests of his companions and previous warnings. This meets the standing requirement for seeking declaratory relief.
  
- **Option (D)**: This option suggests that the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears are speculative. However, given the evidence of prior warnings and the arrest of his companions, this fear is not entirely speculative.

Based on these considerations, the most accurate solution is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly identifies that the law student has standing to seek declaratory relief due to the real and immediate threat of enforcement against him.",0.0,"Analyze the scenario or question comprehensively, identify key elements, and determine the most accurate solution from the provided options.",2
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this scenario comprehensively, let's break down the key elements and understand what happens when a nonconducting sphere with a positive net charge (+Q) is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere.

1. **Nonconducting Sphere**: This sphere has a nonzero net electric charge of +Q.
2. **Neutral Conducting Sphere**: Initially, this sphere has no net electric charge (neutral).
3. **Induction Process**: When the nonconducting sphere with a positive charge is brought close to the neutral conducting sphere, it will induce charges within the conducting sphere.

### Key Concepts:
- **Electric Field Induction in Conductors**: In conductors like metals, when an external electric field is applied or another charged object approaches, free electrons can move and rearrange themselves. This movement of charges results in an induced charge distribution.
- **Charge Distribution on Conductors**: For a neutral conducting sphere, the positive charge from the nonconducting sphere will induce negative charges on the side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere, and positive charges on the opposite side.

### Analysis:
- **Option (A): An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
  - This is true because when a charged object approaches a conductor, it induces an electric field inside the conductor, which rearranges the free electrons.
  
- **Option (B): The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
  - This is not necessarily accurate. While there will be induced charges on the surface of the conducting sphere, these charges will balance out to zero because the overall charge of the conductor remains neutral in the absence of an external field once the nonconducting sphere is removed.
  
- **Option (C): The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
  - This is true due to the induced negative charges on the side of the conducting sphere closest to the positive charge, creating a net attractive force between the two spheres.
  
- **Option (D): The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
  - This is incorrect because there are no like charges that would cause repulsion; instead, opposite charges attract.

### Conclusion:
The most accurate solution from the provided options is:

**(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**

This conclusion is based on the fact that the induced negative charge on one side of the conducting sphere will be attracted to the positive charge of the nonconducting sphere, leading to a net attractive force between them.",0.0,"Analyze the scenario or question comprehensively, identify key elements, and determine the most accurate solution from the provided options.",2
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:

\[
\boxed{5400}
