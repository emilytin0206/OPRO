"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that the expression under the square root is positive and that the denominator is not zero. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Identify where the denominator is defined:**
   The denominator of the function is \( \sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 4} \). For the square root to be defined, the expression inside it must be greater than zero (since the square root of a negative number would not be real and we cannot have division by zero).

2. **Solve the inequality:**
   We need to solve \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \). First, factorize the quadratic expression:
   \[
   x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1)
   \]
   So, we need to find where \( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \).

3. **Determine the intervals:**
   The roots of the equation \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \) are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

4. **Test each interval:**
   - For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \): Choose a test point, say \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
   - For \( x \in (-1, 4) \): Choose a test point, say \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
   - For \( x \in (4, \infty) \): Choose a test point, say \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

   Therefore, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

5. **Combine with the domain of the function:**
   Since we are dealing with a square root in the denominator, the expression must be strictly greater than zero to avoid division by zero or undefined values.

Thus, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:
\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved:

1. **Induced Electric Field in Conductors**: When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, the electric field from the nonconducting sphere will induce charges on the surface of the conducting sphere.

2. **Charge Induction and Distribution**: In a conductor, free electrons can move freely under the influence of an external electric field. The presence of the positively charged nonconducting sphere will push some of these free electrons towards one side of the conducting sphere, leaving the other side with a net positive charge (induced by the external field).

3. **Net Charge on Conductors**: Since the conducting sphere was initially neutral and is now induced to have charges that are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, it will develop a net electric charge of -Q at one end and +Q at the other end due to the redistribution of electrons.

4. **Electrostatic Forces Between Spheres**: The positively charged nonconducting sphere (+Q) will attract the negative side (-Q) of the conducting sphere and repel its positive side (+Q). However, because the conducting sphere is a good conductor, these charges will be distributed such that the overall net charge on the conducting sphere remains -Q (as it was initially neutral).

Given this analysis:

- **Option A**: An electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere due to the external electric field from the nonconducting sphere.
- **Option B**: The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of -Q, not +Q. This is because free electrons in the conductor move to the side closer to the positive charge, leaving that region with a negative charge and the opposite side with a positive charge.
- **Option C**: The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction due to the induced charges on the conducting sphere.
- **Option D**: There would be no repulsion between the spheres because the overall net charge of the conducting sphere remains -Q, which attracts the +Q charge.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**",0.0,Analyze the problem thoroughly and select the correct answer.,1
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (work required),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\( C \)) = 10 µF = \( 10 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F} \)
- Potential difference (\( V \)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F}) \times (100 \, \text{V})^2 \]

Calculate step by step:
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{J} \]
\[ U = 0.005 \, \text{J} \]

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"The correct answer is (C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.

Explanation:

- **Option A** is incorrect. The Supreme Court's decision in *Los Angeles v. Lyons* (1988) established that declaratory judgments should not be dismissed merely because they might interfere with ongoing state prosecutions. The court emphasized that such dismissals would undermine the purpose of declaratory judgment actions, which are meant to provide legal clarity and avoid future disputes.

- **Option B** is incorrect. While a federal plaintiff may seek declaratory relief without being directly threatened by a prosecution, the Supreme Court's decision in *Warth v. Seldin* (1975) requires that there be a ""real and immediate"" threat of enforcement for a declaratory judgment to be granted.

- **Option C** is correct. The law student can demonstrate a genuine threat of enforcement based on the arrest of his companions and prior warnings from the police. This establishes a real and imminent danger, which meets the criteria set by *Warth v. Seldin*.

- **Option D** is incorrect. While it might be argued that the law student's fears are speculative, the Supreme Court has recognized that declaratory judgments can address future threats of enforcement, as evidenced in cases like *Los Angeles v. Lyons*. The arrest and warnings provide a concrete basis for the threat of enforcement against the law student.

Therefore, based on Supreme Court precedent, the federal district court will not dismiss the declaratory judgment action because it is supported by a genuine threat of enforcement.",1.0,Analyze the problem thoroughly and select the correct answer.,1
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the numbers without any remainder.

The given orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

\[ 2^3 = 8 \]
\[ 3^3 = 27 \]
\[ 5^2 = 25 \]

Multiplying these together:
\[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
\[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:

\(\boxed{5400}\)

So, the correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,Analyze the problem thoroughly and select the correct answer.,1
