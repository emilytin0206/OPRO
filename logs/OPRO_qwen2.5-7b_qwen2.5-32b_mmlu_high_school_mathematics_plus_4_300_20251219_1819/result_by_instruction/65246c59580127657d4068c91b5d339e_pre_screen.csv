"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the given scenario.

1. **Nonconducting Sphere with +Q Charge**: This sphere has a net positive charge of +Q. When brought close to another object (in this case, a neutral conducting sphere), it will induce charges on the surface of the conducting sphere due to the electric field created by the nonconducting sphere.

2. **Neutral Conducting Sphere**: A conductor distributes its charge such that the electric field inside is zero. This means any external electric field will cause the free electrons in the conductor to move, redistributing themselves until the net electric field inside the conductor is canceled out.

3. **Induced Charges on the Conducting Sphere**:
   - When a positive charge (+Q) approaches a neutral conducting sphere, it repels the free electrons in the conductor towards the side away from the nonconducting sphere.
   - This leaves an excess of positive charges (induced by the external field) on the side of the conducting sphere that is closest to the nonconducting sphere.

4. **Electrostatic Forces**:
   - The induced positive charge on one part of the conducting sphere will attract the +Q charge from the nonconducting sphere.
   - However, due to the overall neutrality and the redistribution of charges, there won't be a net attraction or repulsion between the two spheres as a whole. Instead, each sphere will experience an attractive force towards the other.

Given these points:

- **Option (A)**: An electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere, but this is not the primary outcome we are looking for.
- **Option (B)**: The conducting sphere does develop charges due to induction, but it won't have a net charge of -Q. Instead, there will be an excess positive charge on one side and an equal negative charge on the other side.
- **Option (C)**: Since both spheres are experiencing attractive forces towards each other due to the induced charges, this is correct.
- **Option (D)**: There won't be a repulsion between the two spheres as they experience mutual attraction.

Therefore, the most precise answer is:

**(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**",0.0,"Analyze the problem context thoroughly, apply relevant theories or calculations as necessary, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer from those provided.",10
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 0.005 J.",0.0,"Analyze the problem context thoroughly, apply relevant theories or calculations as necessary, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer from those provided.",10
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedents and the specific circumstances presented.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that determines the rights of parties without ordering any action or providing relief. The primary purpose is to resolve legal disputes before they lead to more serious consequences.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent**: In cases such as *Warth v. Seldin* (1975), the Supreme Court established criteria for declaratory judgment actions, including:
   - A real and immediate controversy.
   - An actual case or controversy.
   - The existence of a justiciable issue.

3. **Analysis of Options**:

- **Option (A)**: This option suggests that the federal district court would dismiss the action because it interferes with existing state prosecutions, citing equity and comity. While this is an important consideration in some contexts, it does not directly address whether there is a justiciable issue or immediate controversy.

- **Option (B)**: This option states that a federal plaintiff may seek declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute. However, the Supreme Court's criteria for declaratory judgments require more than just potential future threats; there must be an actual case or controversy.

- **Option (C)**: This option argues that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on the arrest of his companions and prior warnings. Given the Supreme Court’s requirement for a real and immediate controversy, this option aligns well with the facts presented, as there is evidence of past enforcement actions.

- **Option (D)**: This option suggests that the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears are speculative. While it acknowledges the speculative nature, it does not fully address whether a justiciable issue exists based on the factual context provided.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on Supreme Court precedent and the specific circumstances of this case, where there is evidence of past enforcement actions (arrests of companions) and prior warnings, the law student can demonstrate a genuine threat of future enforcement against him. Therefore, the federal district court would likely not dismiss the declaratory judgment action.

**Final Answer: (C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This answer aligns with the legal principles that require a justiciable issue and an actual case or controversy for a declaratory judgment to be granted.",1.0,"Analyze the problem context thoroughly, apply relevant theories or calculations as necessary, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer from those provided.",10
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, determine where this product is greater than zero. The roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \) are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero and we already ensured that it's positive in these intervals, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM will give us the minimum number of days after which all three planets will be in their initial positions relative to each other again.

The given orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:
