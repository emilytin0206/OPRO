"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Setup**: We have two spheres - one nonconducting sphere with a net electric charge +Q and a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius.

2. **Electric Field Induction in Conductors**:
   - When a charged object is brought close to a conductor, an induced charge distribution occurs on the surface of the conductor. This happens because free electrons within the conductor can move around due to their mobility.
   - The side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere will experience a higher electric field and thus will have more negative charges induced on it. Conversely, the far side will have an excess of positive charges.

3. **Charge Induction**:
   - Since the conducting sphere is neutral initially, when brought close to the charged nonconducting sphere, electrons in the conductor will be attracted towards the side closer to the nonconducting sphere.
   - This results in a net negative charge on one side and a net positive charge on the other side of the conducting sphere.

4. **Electrostatic Forces**:
   - The induced charges on the conducting sphere will create an electric field that interacts with the +Q charge of the nonconducting sphere.
   - According to Coulomb's law, opposite charges attract each other and like charges repel each other. Therefore, the positive charge (+Q) in the nonconducting sphere will experience a force towards the side of the conducting sphere where there is an induced negative charge.

Now let's evaluate the options:

(A) **An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere**.
   - This statement is true but not the most accurate answer to the question. The electric field is indeed induced, but this is a consequence rather than the primary outcome we are asked about.

(B) **The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q**.
   - This is incorrect because while there will be an induced negative charge on one side and positive on the other, the overall charge of the conductor remains zero due to its ability to redistribute charges without changing the total charge (conservation of charge).

(C) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction**.
   - This statement accurately describes the interaction between the two spheres. The induced negative charge on one side of the conducting sphere attracts the positive charge +Q from the nonconducting sphere.

(D) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion**.
   - This is incorrect because there are no like charges that would cause repulsion in this scenario; instead, opposite charges attract each other.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the information given and the principles of electrostatics is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement in detail, apply relevant principles or perform necessary calculations, and select the most accurate answer from the provided options based on the information given.",14
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Next, multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To analyze this problem statement, we need to consider principles from constitutional law, specifically focusing on the Declaratory Judgment Act (28 U.S.C. § 2201-2202) and Supreme Court precedents regarding declaratory judgments.

The key points are:
1. The law student has filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court.
2. He is seeking an advance ruling on the constitutionality of criminal trespass and loitering statutes.
3. His companions were arrested for these offenses, and he received prior warnings from police.

Let's examine each option:

(A) **Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**
- This option suggests that a federal court should not issue a declaratory judgment because it might interfere with ongoing state proceedings. However, this is not necessarily true under current Supreme Court precedents.

(B) **No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.**
- This option is incorrect as it does not consider the specific circumstances of the case and the potential for interference in ongoing proceedings.

(C) **No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**
- This option seems plausible but needs to be evaluated further based on Supreme Court precedents.

(D) **Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.**
- This option suggests that the court should dismiss the action due to the speculative nature of the law student’s fears. However, the existence of prior warnings and arrests can provide a basis for a genuine threat.

Given these considerations, we need to look at relevant Supreme Court cases such as *Warth v. Seldin* (1975), which established that a plaintiff must show a ""real and immediate"" threat of prosecution to obtain declaratory relief. The arrest of the companions and prior warnings can be seen as evidence of this real and immediate threat.

Therefore, based on Supreme Court precedent, the most accurate answer is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly identifies that the law student has demonstrated a sufficient basis for seeking declaratory relief due to the real and immediate threat posed by the criminal trespass and loitering statutes.",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement in detail, apply relevant principles or perform necessary calculations, and select the most accurate answer from the provided options based on the information given.",14
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, we factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

So, the inequality becomes:

\[ (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \]

To solve this inequality, we find the roots of the equation \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

Next, we test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

From this analysis, we see that the inequality \( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \) holds for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Therefore, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers without any remainder.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:
