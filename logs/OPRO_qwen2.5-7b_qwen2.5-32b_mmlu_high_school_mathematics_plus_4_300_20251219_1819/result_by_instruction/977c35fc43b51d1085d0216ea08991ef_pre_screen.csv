"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 0.005 J.",0.0,"Analyze the question or problem in depth, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate options that do not align with the provided information, and select the most accurate answer from those given.",17
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, we factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

So, the inequality becomes:

\[ (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \]

To solve this inequality, we find the roots of the equation \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

Next, we test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

From this analysis, we see that the inequality \( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \) holds for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Therefore, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's break down the scenario and apply relevant principles from electrostatics.

1. **Initial Setup**: We have a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius.

2. **Electric Field Induction in Conductors**:
   - When a charged object is placed near a conductor, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. The induced charges rearrange themselves such that the electric field inside the conductor remains zero (one of the fundamental properties of conductors).

3. **Induced Charges on the Conducting Sphere**:
   - Since the nonconducting sphere has a positive charge +Q and is brought close to the neutral conducting sphere, it will induce an equal but opposite charge –Q on one side of the conducting sphere and an equal amount of +Q on the other side (to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor).

4. **Electrostatic Forces Between Spheres**:
   - The positive charges on the nonconducting sphere will attract the negative charges induced on the conducting sphere, leading to an electrostatic attraction between the two spheres.

Now let's evaluate each option:

(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
- This is true. However, it does not directly answer what happens between the two spheres.

(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
- This statement is incorrect because while there will be an induced –Q charge on one side and +Q on the other, the overall charge of the conductor remains zero due to its ability to rearrange charges without changing the total charge.

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
- This is correct. The positive charge on the nonconducting sphere attracts the negative charge induced on the conducting sphere.

(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.
- This is incorrect because the charges are of opposite signs, leading to an attractive force, not a repulsive one.

Therefore, the most accurate answer from the given options is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",0.0,"Analyze the question or problem in depth, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate options that do not align with the provided information, and select the most accurate answer from those given.",17
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider relevant legal principles, particularly those established by the U.S. Supreme Court regarding declaratory judgment actions and their relationship with state prosecutions.

### Analysis:

1. **Supreme Court Precedent**: The key case here is *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club*, 451 U.S. 287 (1981). In this case, the Supreme Court held that a declaratory judgment action seeking an advisory opinion on the constitutionality of state statutes would be dismissed if it interfered with ongoing or threatened state prosecutions.

2. **Equity and Comity**: The doctrine of equity and comity suggests that federal courts should avoid interfering with state criminal proceedings unless there is a clear and present danger to the plaintiff's rights. This principle aligns closely with *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club*.

3. **Threat of Enforcement**: The law student argues that he faces a genuine threat of enforcement because his companions were arrested, and he received prior warnings from the police. However, this alone does not necessarily override the principles of equity and comity unless the threat is imminent or highly likely to materialize.

4. **Prematurity of the Action**: The Supreme Court has also held that declaratory relief may be premature if the plaintiff's fears are speculative. In *Warth v. Seldin*, 422 U.S. 490 (1975), the Court emphasized that a declaratory judgment should not be granted when there is no immediate or imminent threat of enforcement.

### Applying the Analysis to the Options:

- **Option A**: This option aligns with *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club* and the principles of equity and comity, suggesting that the federal district court would likely dismiss the action if it interferes with existing state prosecutions.
  
- **Option B**: This is incorrect because the law student's status as a plaintiff does not automatically entitle him to seek declaratory relief without showing a genuine threat of enforcement.

- **Option C**: While this option acknowledges the arrest and warnings, it does not address the core issue that the federal court should avoid interfering with state prosecutions unless there is an imminent or highly likely threat. The arrest of companions and prior warnings alone do not necessarily justify granting declaratory relief without more immediate evidence of a threat.

- **Option D**: This option correctly identifies the speculative nature of the law student's fears, aligning with *Warth v. Seldin* that such actions should be dismissed if the fears are merely speculative.

### Conclusion:

The most accurate answer is (D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part. This option correctly applies the principles established by the Supreme Court regarding the premature nature of such actions and the need for an imminent or highly likely threat to justify granting declaratory relief.

**Final Answer: (D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.**",0.0,"Analyze the question or problem in depth, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate options that do not align with the provided information, and select the most accurate answer from those given.",17
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the numbers without any remainder.

The given orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Identify the Highest Powers of Each Prime**:
   - For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

3. **Calculate LCM**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2
   \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     - \(2^3 = 8\)
     - \(3^3 = 27\)
     - \(5^2 = 25\)

4. **Multiply the Results**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 8 \times 27 \times 25
   \]
   - First, multiply 8 and 27:
     \[
     8 \times 27 = 216
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by 25:
     \[
     216 \times 25 = 5400
     \]

Thus, the least common multiple of 360, 450, and 540 is 5400.

### Conclusion:

The minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,"Analyze the question or problem in depth, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate options that do not align with the provided information, and select the most accurate answer from those given.",17
