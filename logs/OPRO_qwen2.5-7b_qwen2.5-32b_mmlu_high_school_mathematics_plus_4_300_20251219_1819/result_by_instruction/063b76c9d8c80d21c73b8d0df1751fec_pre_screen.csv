"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

First, calculate \( V^2 \):

\[ V^2 = (100 V)^2 = 10000 V^2 \]

Now substitute this back into the equation:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} J \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 J \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 0.005 J.",0.0,"Analyze the question in depth, use relevant principles or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on the provided information, and select the most precise answer from those given.",14
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, determine where this product is greater than zero. The roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \) are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero and we have already ensured that it is positive in these intervals, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the scenario described.

1. **Induced Electric Field (Option A):**
   - When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere. This is because the presence of the charged nonconducting sphere will cause charges in the conducting sphere to rearrange themselves due to electrostatic induction.
   - In a conductor, free electrons are not fixed and can move freely throughout the material. When a positive charge approaches one side of the conductor, these free electrons will be repelled towards the opposite side, creating an induced negative charge on that side and an induced positive charge on the approaching side.

2. **Net Electric Charge (Option B):**
   - The conducting sphere initially has no net electric charge. However, due to electrostatic induction, charges will rearrange themselves but the total charge of the conductor remains zero because the movement of electrons within the conductor does not change its overall charge balance.
   - Therefore, the conducting sphere cannot develop a net electric charge of –Q; it can only have induced charges on specific regions.

3. **Electrostatic Forces (Options C and D):**
   - The electrostatic force between two charged objects depends on their respective charges and the distance between them. Since the nonconducting sphere has a positive charge +Q, and due to induction, one side of the conducting sphere will have an induced negative charge.
   - This means there is now a net attractive force between the spheres because opposite charges attract each other.

Given these principles:

- Option A (An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere) is correct but not the most precise answer in terms of what directly results from the interaction.
- Option B (The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q) is incorrect as the total charge remains zero due to the rearrangement of charges.
- Option C (The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction) is correct and describes the direct result of the induced charges on both spheres.
- Option D (The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion) is incorrect because opposite charges attract, not repel.

Therefore, the most precise answer based on the principles described is:

**C. The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**",0.0,"Analyze the question in depth, use relevant principles or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on the provided information, and select the most precise answer from those given.",14
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider principles from constitutional law, specifically related to declaratory judgment actions and the balance between federal and state interests.

### Analysis:

1. **Declaratory Judgment Act (DJA) - 28 U.S.C. § 2201**: This act allows a person ""to have determined any question of construction of an act of Congress, or [of] any treaty or statute of, or commission created by, the United States"" and to obtain a declaration of rights.

2. **Supreme Court Precedents**:
   - **Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Co., 421 U.S. 723 (1975)**: The Supreme Court held that declaratory judgments are not available when they would interfere with pending or impending state criminal proceedings.
   - **Pennhurst State School & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89 (1984)**: This case further emphasized the principle of comity and equity in federal-state relations.

3. **Equity and Comity**:
   - The principle of equity suggests that courts should not issue orders that would interfere with ongoing state proceedings.
   - Comity refers to the respect that one jurisdiction has for another's laws, policies, or judicial decisions.

4. **Genuine Threat of Enforcement**:
   - The law student can argue a genuine threat based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings from the police.

### Evaluating Each Option:

- **Option (A)**: This option correctly identifies that declaratory relief could interfere with existing state prosecutions, aligning with Supreme Court precedent. However, it does not fully consider the law student's potential for a genuine threat.
  
- **Option (B)**: This is incorrect because the federal plaintiff cannot seek declaratory judgment if there is an ongoing or impending state prosecution, as per Blue Chip Stamps and Pennhurst.

- **Option (C)**: While this option acknowledges the law student’s fear of future arrest, it does not address the interference with existing prosecutions, which is a critical factor in Supreme Court precedent.

- **Option (D)**: This suggests that the declaratory relief would be premature due to speculative fears. However, the prior warnings and arrests provide a basis for a genuine threat, making this option less precise than necessary.

### Conclusion:

The most accurate answer is **(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity**. This option correctly identifies the legal principle that prevents interference with ongoing or impending state criminal proceedings, as established by Supreme Court precedent.",0.0,"Analyze the question in depth, use relevant principles or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on the provided information, and select the most precise answer from those given.",14
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For the prime factor \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For the prime factor \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For the prime factor \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:

\[
\boxed{5400}
