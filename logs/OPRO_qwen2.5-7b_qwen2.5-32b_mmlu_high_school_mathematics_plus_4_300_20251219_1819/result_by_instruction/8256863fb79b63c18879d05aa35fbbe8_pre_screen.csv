"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's break down the scenario and apply relevant principles from electrostatics.

1. **Initial Setup**: We have a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius.

2. **Induced Charges in Conductors**:
   - When a charged object is placed near a conductor, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. The side of the conductor closest to the charged object will develop an induced negative charge, and the far side will develop an induced positive charge.
   
3. **Electric Field within the Conductor**: In a conductor at electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside must be zero because free charges can move until they neutralize any internal electric fields.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - (A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere: This is true due to the induction process.
   - (B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q: This is incorrect because the total charge on the conductor must remain zero in an isolated system. Only the distribution of charges changes, not the overall charge.
   - (C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction: This is true due to the induced negative charge on the side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere with +Q.
   - (D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion: This is incorrect because the charges are opposite, leading to attraction.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the principles of electrostatics and induction in conductors, the most accurate answer is:

**(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**

This conclusion aligns with the fact that a positive charge (+Q) placed near a neutral conductor will induce a negative charge on the side closest to it, leading to an attractive force between the two spheres.",0.0,"Analyze the question deeply, apply relevant theories or calculations as necessary, eliminate incorrect options based on given information, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",13
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, we factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \).

Next, we determine where this product is greater than zero. The roots of the equation are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:

- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x < -1 \) and \( x > 4 \). Therefore, the domain of the function must exclude the interval where the expression under the square root is non-positive.

Additionally, we need to ensure that the denominator is not zero. The roots of the equation are already excluded from our intervals since they make the expression under the square root zero or negative.

Therefore, combining these conditions, the domain of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

(C) \((-inf, -1) U (4, inf)\).",1.0,"Analyze the question deeply, apply relevant theories or calculations as necessary, eliminate incorrect options based on given information, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",13
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider relevant legal principles, particularly those related to declaratory judgment actions and the conditions under which such actions can be granted. The key points from Supreme Court precedent that will guide our analysis include:

1. **Rooker-Feldman Doctrine**: This doctrine generally bars federal district courts from hearing cases involving state court judgments or claims that are inextricably intertwined with pending or previously decided state proceedings.

2. **Declaratory Judgment Act (DJA)**: The DJA, 28 U.S.C. § 2201-2202, allows a person ""to have determined any question of construction of an act of Congress or the validity of an act of an administrative agency under federal law"" and to obtain a declaration of rights.

3. **Standing**: A plaintiff must show that they have suffered or are imminently threatened with injury for which declaratory relief is sought.

4. **Mootness**: An issue becomes moot if it cannot be resolved by the court's decision, such as when the threat of enforcement has passed or been removed.

Given these principles:

- The law student filed a declaratory judgment action to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of criminal statutes.
- His companions were arrested for criminal trespass and loitering after continuing their protest despite warnings from the police.
- The law student is not currently facing arrest but fears future enforcement against him.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) **Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**
   - This option suggests that the action could interfere with ongoing state proceedings. However, the law student is not currently facing prosecution; he fears future enforcement. Therefore, this reason does not apply.

(B) **No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.**
   - This option is incorrect because the fear of future enforcement must be sufficiently imminent to establish standing and justify a declaratory judgment action.

(C) **No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**
   - This option correctly identifies that the law student has shown a genuine threat of future enforcement based on the arrests of his companions and previous warnings from the police. This establishes standing for a declaratory judgment action.

(D) **Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.**
   - While it is true that the law student’s fears might seem speculative, the Supreme Court has recognized that fear of imminent enforcement can establish standing for a declaratory judgment action.

Based on these analyses and considering the relevant legal principles:

The most accurate answer is **(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**",1.0,"Analyze the question deeply, apply relevant theories or calculations as necessary, eliminate incorrect options based on given information, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",13
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers without any remainder.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

Let's calculate the LCM step-by-step:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Identify the Highest Powers of Each Prime**:
   - For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

3. **Calculate LCM**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2
   \]
   \[
   = 8 \times 27 \times 25
   \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication**:
   - First, multiply \(8\) and \(27\):
     \[
     8 \times 27 = 216
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by \(25\):
     \[
     216 \times 25 = 5400
     \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is **5400**.
