"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, determine where this product is greater than zero. The roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \) are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero and we have already ensured that it is positive in these intervals, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedents and the specific circumstances presented.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that determines the rights of parties without ordering any action or providing relief. The primary purpose is to resolve legal disputes before they lead to more serious consequences.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent**: In cases like *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club* (1970), the Supreme Court established that a declaratory judgment can be granted even if there's no immediate threat of prosecution, as long as the plaintiff can show a ""real and immediate"" controversy.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: This suggests dismissing the action due to interference with state prosecutions. However, this is not necessarily true based on Supreme Court precedent which allows for declaratory judgments even when there's no direct threat.
   - **Option B**: This option states that a federal plaintiff can seek a declaratory judgment regardless of whether they are threatened by a state prosecution. While this might be generally true, it doesn't fully address the ""real and immediate"" controversy requirement.
   - **Option C**: This suggests granting relief because the law student can show a genuine threat based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings. This aligns with the Supreme Court's requirement for a real and immediate controversy.
   - **Option D**: This option dismisses the action as premature due to speculative fears, which doesn't consider the ""real and immediate"" nature of the threat.

Given these considerations, the most accurate answer is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly identifies that the law student has demonstrated a real and immediate controversy, which meets the criteria for seeking declaratory relief under Supreme Court precedent.",1.0,"Analyze the problem context thoroughly, apply relevant theories or calculations, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",10
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the given scenario.

1. **Nonconducting Sphere with +Q Charge**: This sphere has a net positive charge of +Q. When brought close to another object (in this case, a neutral conducting sphere), it will induce charges on the surface of the conducting sphere due to the electric field created by the nonconducting sphere.

2. **Neutral Conducting Sphere**: A conductor distributes its charge such that the electric field inside is zero. This means any external electric field will cause the free electrons in the conductor to move, redistributing themselves until the net electric field inside the conductor is canceled out.

3. **Induced Charges on the Conducting Sphere**:
   - When a positive charge (+Q) approaches a neutral conducting sphere, it repels the free electrons in the conductor towards the side away from the nonconducting sphere.
   - This leaves an excess of positive charges (induced by the external field) on the side of the conducting sphere that is closest to the nonconducting sphere.

4. **Electrostatic Forces**:
   - The induced positive charge (+Q) on one part of the conducting sphere will attract the +Q charge from the nonconducting sphere.
   - However, due to the redistribution of charges and the overall neutrality of the conductor, there is no net charge that can be transferred between the spheres. Instead, an electrostatic attraction occurs because opposite charges attract.

Now let's evaluate each option:

(A) **An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere**.
   - This statement is true but not the most accurate answer in this context since we are more interested in the overall interaction and resulting forces between the spheres.

(B) **The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q**.
   - This is incorrect because, although there will be an induced positive charge on one side and a corresponding negative charge on the other side due to electron redistribution, the total charge of the conductor remains zero (neutral).

(C) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction**.
   - This is correct. The nonconducting sphere with +Q will attract the induced negative charges on the conducting sphere.

(D) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion**.
   - This is incorrect because there are no like charges (both positive or both negative) that would cause repulsion between the two spheres in this scenario.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",0.0,"Analyze the problem context thoroughly, apply relevant theories or calculations, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",10
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the numbers without any remainder.

The given orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For the prime factor \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For the prime factor \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For the prime factor \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

\[ 2^3 = 8 \]
\[ 3^3 = 27 \]
\[ 5^2 = 25 \]

Multiplying these together:
\[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
\[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.
