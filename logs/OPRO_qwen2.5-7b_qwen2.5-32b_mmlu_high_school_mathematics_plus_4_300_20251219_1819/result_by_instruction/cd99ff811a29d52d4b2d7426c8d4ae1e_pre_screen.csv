"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To analyze this question accurately, we need to consider principles from constitutional law, specifically related to declaratory judgment actions and the balance between federal and state interests.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a legal remedy that allows a court to declare the rights of parties without ordering any specific action or awarding damages. The primary purpose is to resolve legal uncertainties before they lead to actual disputes.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent and Federalism**: The Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of federalism, which involves respecting state sovereignty while ensuring that federal courts can provide necessary relief when there are genuine threats of enforcement against individuals.

3. **Equity and Comity**: Courts often consider equity (fairness) and comity (respect for other jurisdictions' laws) in deciding whether to grant declaratory relief. However, these considerations do not necessarily preclude a court from granting such relief if the plaintiff can show a genuine threat of enforcement.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: This suggests that the federal district court would dismiss the action because it interferes with existing state prosecutions. While this is a valid concern, Supreme Court precedent has generally allowed for declaratory judgments in cases where there is a genuine threat of enforcement.
   - **Option B**: This option states that a plaintiff may seek declaratory judgment even if not directly threatened by prosecution. However, the Supreme Court has required some level of actual or imminent threat to justify such an action.
   - **Option C**: This suggests that the law student can show a genuine threat based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings. Given the Supreme Court's stance on declaratory judgments in cases involving potential enforcement actions, this option seems more aligned with legal principles.
   - **Option D**: This states that the relief would be premature because of speculative fears. While it is true that future threats can sometimes be speculative, the law student has concrete evidence (arrests and warnings) to support his claim.

5. **Conclusion Based on Supreme Court Precedent**:
The most precise answer based on Supreme Court precedent is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly identifies that the law student has demonstrated a concrete and imminent threat to his rights, which justifies seeking declaratory relief in federal court.",1.0,"Analyze the question in detail, apply relevant principles or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer based on the information provided.",16
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's break down each option and apply relevant principles from electrostatics.

### Given:
- A nonconducting sphere with a net electric charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius.

### Analysis:

1. **Option (A): An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
   - When a charged object approaches a conductor, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. The side of the conductor closest to the charge will develop an opposite charge, and the far side will develop a similar charge but in smaller magnitude due to screening effects.
   - This is correct because the electric field from the nonconducting sphere will induce charges within the conducting sphere.

2. **Option (B): The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
   - A neutral conductor cannot have a net charge; it can only redistribute its charges on the surface due to the influence of an external charge.
   - Therefore, this statement is incorrect because the total charge of the conducting sphere remains zero.

3. **Option (C): The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
   - Since one sphere has a positive charge (+Q) and the other is neutral but induced with charges due to proximity, there will be both attractive and repulsive forces.
   - However, considering the overall effect of induction, the net force between them would indeed be attractive because the induced negative charge on the side closest to +Q will attract the positive charge.

4. **Option (D): The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
   - This is incorrect for the same reason as option C; the induced charges will result in an overall attractive force, not a repulsive one.

### Conclusion:
The most precise answer based on the principles of electrostatics and induction is:

**(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**",0.0,"Analyze the question in detail, apply relevant principles or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer based on the information provided.",16
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

### Step 1: Factorize the quadratic expression
First, we factorize the quadratic equation:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

### Step 2: Determine where the factors are zero
Set each factor to zero to find the critical points:
\[ x - 4 = 0 \implies x = 4 \]
\[ x + 1 = 0 \implies x = -1 \]

These points divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 3: Test each interval
We need to determine where the product \((x-4)(x+1)\) is positive. We can test a point in each interval:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \), choose \( x = -2 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]

- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \), choose \( x = 0 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \), choose \( x = 5 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

### Step 4: Combine the results
The expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \) is positive in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 5: Consider the denominator
Since the function includes a square root in the denominator, we must ensure that the expression inside the square root is strictly greater than zero. Therefore, we exclude the points where it equals zero:
\[ x = -1 \text{ and } x = 4 \]

Thus, the domain of \( f(x) \) is the union of the intervals where the expression is positive:
\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

### Conclusion
The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{(C) (-\infty, -1) U (4, \infty)} \]",1.0,"Analyze the question in detail, apply relevant principles or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer based on the information provided.",16
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:
