"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done to charge the capacitor),
- \( C \) is the capacitance of the capacitor,
- \( V \) is the potential difference across the capacitor.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

First, calculate \( (100 V)^2 \):

\[ (100 V)^2 = 10000 V^2 \]

Now substitute this back into the equation:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times 10000 V^2 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 \times 10^{-3} J \]
\[ U = 50 \times 10^{-3} J \]
\[ U = 0.05 J \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the scenario described.

1. **Nonconducting Sphere with +Q Charge**: This sphere has a net positive charge of +Q. When brought close to another object (in this case, a neutral conducting sphere), it will induce charges on the surface of the conducting sphere due to the electric field created by the nonconducting sphere.

2. **Induced Charges in Conductors**: In conductors like metals, free electrons can move freely throughout the material. When an external electric field is applied (as would be the case when a charged object approaches), these free electrons will rearrange themselves to counteract the field as much as possible. This results in induced charges on the surface of the conductor.

3. **Neutral Conducting Sphere**: Initially, this sphere has no net charge. When brought close to the nonconducting sphere with +Q charge, the side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere will develop a negative charge (induced by the positive field from the nonconducting sphere), and the far side will develop an equal but opposite positive charge.

4. **Electrostatic Forces**: The induced charges on the conducting sphere will create their own electric fields, which interact with the original +Q charge of the nonconducting sphere. This interaction results in an attractive force between the two spheres because opposite charges attract each other.

Now let's evaluate the options:

(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
- **True**: The electric field from the nonconducting sphere will induce a separation of charges on the surface of the conducting sphere, but this does not mean an electric field is induced inside the conductor. Inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, there are no net electric fields.

(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
- **False**: The conducting sphere will develop a net charge distribution with one side having a negative charge and the other side having an equal positive charge, but it does not have a net charge overall. The charges cancel each other out inside the conductor.

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
- **True**: Due to the induced negative charge on the side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere and the positive charge on the far side, there is an attractive force between the two spheres.

(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.
- **False**: As explained above, due to the induced charges, there will be an attractive force rather than a repulsive one.

Therefore, based on this analysis, the most precise answer is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",0.0,"Analyze the context of the question carefully, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on logical reasoning, and select the most precise answer from those provided.",11
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedents and the specific circumstances presented.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that determines the rights of parties without ordering any action or providing relief. The primary purpose is to resolve legal disputes before they lead to more serious consequences.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent**: In cases like *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club* (1970), the Supreme Court established that a declaratory judgment can be granted even if there's no immediate threat of prosecution, as long as the plaintiff can show a ""real and immediate"" controversy.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: This suggests dismissing the action due to interference with state prosecutions. However, this is not necessarily true based on Supreme Court precedent which allows for declaratory judgments even when there's no direct threat.
   - **Option B**: This option states that a federal plaintiff can seek a declaratory judgment regardless of whether they are threatened by a state prosecution. While this might be generally true, it doesn't fully address the ""real and immediate"" controversy requirement.
   - **Option C**: This suggests granting relief because the law student can show a genuine threat based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings. This aligns with the Supreme Court's requirement for a real and imminent threat of enforcement.
   - **Option D**: This dismisses the action as premature due to speculative fears, which doesn't consider the ""real and immediate"" controversy established by the arrests and warnings.

Given these considerations, the most precise answer is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly identifies that the law student has demonstrated a real and immediate threat of prosecution based on the actions taken against his friends and the previous warnings from the police.",1.0,"Analyze the context of the question carefully, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on logical reasoning, and select the most precise answer from those provided.",11
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, determine where this product is greater than zero. The roots of the equation are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero and we have already excluded the points where it would be zero (\( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \)), these values are not part of the domain.

Therefore, the domain of the function is:
\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3 = 8\)
2. Calculate \(3^3 = 27\)
3. Calculate \(5^2 = 25\)

Then multiply these together:
\[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
\[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.
