"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers, and the denominator cannot be zero.
2. We need to solve the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, let's factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, we find the roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We need to test each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
- For \( x < -1 \): Choose a test point, say \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose a test point, say \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose a test point, say \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Therefore, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Thus, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:
\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"The correct answer is (C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.

Explanation:
- **Option A** is incorrect. While it's true that declaratory judgments should generally avoid interfering with ongoing state prosecutions, this does not apply here since the law student has already been warned and his companions have been arrested.
  
- **Option B** is incorrect because the Supreme Court precedent allows a federal plaintiff to seek declaratory relief even if they are not directly threatened by a state prosecution. The fact that the law student was not directly involved in the arrest does not preclude him from seeking declaratory relief.

- **Option D** is incorrect as well, although it correctly identifies that the fear of future arrest might be speculative, the Supreme Court has recognized that a genuine threat of enforcement can justify seeking declaratory relief. The prior warnings and arrests of his companions provide sufficient evidence to show such a threat exists for the law student.

- **Option C** accurately reflects the legal principle that a federal court may grant declaratory relief when there is a ""genuine threat"" of enforcement, as evidenced by the actions taken against the law student's friends. This option correctly identifies the relevant factors and aligns with Supreme Court precedent on this issue.

Therefore, based on the given information and Supreme Court precedent, the federal district court will not dismiss the declaratory judgment action filed by the law student.",1.0,Analyze each option carefully in relation to the problem statement and select the most accurate answer based on the given information.,2
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved:

1. **Induced Electric Field in Conductors**: When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, the charges within the conducting sphere will rearrange themselves due to the influence of the external electric field created by the nonconducting sphere.

2. **Charge Induction on Conductors**: In a conductor, free electrons can move freely and will be influenced by an external electric field. The side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere with +Q charge will experience a higher electric field strength compared to the opposite side. This causes the free electrons in the conducting sphere to move towards the far side from the nonconducting sphere, leaving a net positive charge on the near side and a net negative charge on the far side.

3. **Electrostatic Forces**: The electrostatic force between two charges is attractive if they are of opposite signs and repulsive if they are of the same sign. Since the nonconducting sphere has a +Q charge, it will attract any negative charges (induced by rearrangement) towards itself while repelling positive charges.

Given these principles:

- **Option A**: An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere. This is true because the free electrons in the conductor will move to create an induced electric field that opposes the external field, but this does not describe a net charge transfer.
  
- **Option B**: The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q. This is incorrect because while there will be a redistribution of charges (with a net negative charge on one side and positive on the other), the overall charge of the conductor remains zero due to its ability to distribute charges evenly.

- **Option C**: The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction. This is true because the induced negative charge on the near side of the conducting sphere will attract the +Q charge from the nonconducting sphere, leading to a net attractive force between them.

- **Option D**: The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion. This is incorrect based on the analysis above; there should be attraction rather than repulsion.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is:

**C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**",0.0,Analyze each option carefully in relation to the problem statement and select the most accurate answer based on the given information.,2
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

Calculate step by step:
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To determine the minimum positive number of days after which planets X, Y, and Z will be aligned again in their initial positions relative to each other and the sun, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their orbital periods. The orbital periods are 360 days for planet X, 450 days for planet Y, and 540 days for planet Z.

First, let's factorize each number into its prime factors:
- \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
- \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
- \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in these factorizations:
- The highest power of 2 is \(2^3\).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^3\).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\).

Thus, the LCM is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 = 8 \times 27 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.
