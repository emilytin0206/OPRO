"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

Calculate step by step:
1. Calculate \( V^2 \):
   \[ V^2 = (100 V)^2 = 10000 V^2 \]
   
2. Multiply the capacitance by \( V^2 \):
   \[ C \times V^2 = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \times 10000 V^2 = 10 \times 10^{-2} J = 0.1 J \]
   
3. Finally, multiply by \( \frac{1}{2} \):
   \[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.1 J = 0.05 J \]

Therefore, the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V is:

\[ \boxed{0.05 J} \]

So, the correct answer is (C) 0.05 J.",1.0,"Analyze the question or information provided thoroughly, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, critically evaluate each option, and select the most precise answer based on the given details.",8
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's break down each option and apply relevant principles from electrostatics.

### Given:
- A nonconducting sphere with a net electric charge \( +Q \).
- A neutral conducting sphere of the same radius as the nonconducting sphere.
- The nonconducting sphere is brought close to the conducting sphere.

### Analysis:

1. **Option (A): An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
   - When a charged object approaches a conductor, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. These induced charges rearrange themselves such that the electric field inside the conductor remains zero.
   - This is due to the free electrons in the conductor being able to move and redistribute themselves in response to the external electric field.

2. **Option (B): The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
   - A neutral conducting sphere cannot have a net charge; it must remain electrically neutral overall.
   - However, charges can be induced on its surface, but these charges do not add up to give the sphere a net charge.

3. **Option (C): The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
   - According to Coulomb's law, opposite charges attract and like charges repel.
   - Since the nonconducting sphere has a positive charge \( +Q \), it will induce a negative charge on one side of the conducting sphere and a positive charge on the other side due to the redistribution of electrons.
   - The induced negative charge on the side facing the nonconducting sphere will attract the positive charge, leading to an overall attractive force between the two spheres.

4. **Option (D): The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
   - This is incorrect because there are no like charges that would result in a repulsive force between the spheres based on the given scenario.
   - The induced charges on the conducting sphere will be of opposite signs to those of the nonconducting sphere, leading to attraction rather than repulsion.

### Conclusion:
The most precise answer based on the principles of electrostatics is:

- **(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**

This conclusion is supported by the fact that a positive charge on one object (the nonconducting sphere) will induce a negative charge on the side of the conducting sphere facing it, resulting in an attractive force between them.",0.0,"Analyze the question or information provided thoroughly, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, critically evaluate each option, and select the most precise answer based on the given details.",8
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedents and the specific circumstances presented.

### Analysis:

1. **Supreme Court Precedent**: The key case here is *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club*, 451 U.S. 287 (1981). In this case, the Supreme Court held that a declaratory judgment action seeking an advisory opinion on the constitutionality of state statutes would be dismissed if it interfered with ongoing or threatened state prosecutions.

2. **Nature of the Action**: The law student is filing for declaratory relief to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of criminal trespass and loitering laws, which his companions were arrested under. This action seeks a determination that these laws are unconstitutional.

3. **Threat of Enforcement**: While the law student's companions have been arrested, this does not necessarily mean there is a direct threat against him at present. The arrest of others could be due to different circumstances or reasons unrelated to the specific actions he plans to take.

4. **Speculative Nature of Future Arrests**: The Supreme Court has also held that declaratory relief should not be granted if the plaintiff's fears are speculative and there is no immediate threat of enforcement against them. This principle is derived from *Warth v. Seldin*, 422 U.S. 490 (1975), where the Court emphasized that a plaintiff must show a ""real and immediate"" threat to justify seeking declaratory relief.

### Evaluation of Options:

- **Option A**: This option suggests dismissing the action because it would interfere with existing state prosecutions, which is based on *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club*. However, this reasoning applies more directly when there are ongoing or threatened prosecutions against the plaintiff themselves.
  
- **Option B**: This option states that a federal plaintiff may seek declaratory judgment even if not threatened by a state prosecution. While technically true, it does not address the specific circumstances of the case and the need for a ""real and immediate"" threat.

- **Option C**: This option argues that the law student can show a genuine threat based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings. However, as noted earlier, this is insufficient to establish an immediate or real threat against him specifically.

- **Option D**: This option correctly identifies that the declaratory relief would be premature because the fears of future arrest are speculative. It aligns with *Warth v. Seldin* and other Supreme Court precedents emphasizing the need for a ""real and immediate"" threat to justify seeking declaratory relief.

### Conclusion:

The most precise answer is **(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.** This option correctly applies relevant legal principles and Supreme Court precedents to the specific circumstances presented in the question.",0.0,"Analyze the question or information provided thoroughly, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, critically evaluate each option, and select the most precise answer based on the given details.",8
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

So, we need to solve:

\[ (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \]

To find the intervals where this inequality holds true, we determine the roots of the equation \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

Next, we test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the inequality \( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \) is satisfied in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero, we exclude the points where the expression under the square root equals zero, which are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \). Therefore, these points must also be excluded from the domain.

Combining all this information, the domain of the function is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers without any remainder.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Identify the Highest Powers of Each Prime**:
   - For \(2\): The highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\): The highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\): The highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

3. **Calculate the LCM**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2
   \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     - \(2^3 = 8\)
     - \(3^3 = 27\)
     - \(5^2 = 25\)

4. **Multiply the Results**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 8 \times 27 \times 25
   \]
   - First, multiply 8 and 27:
     \[
     8 \times 27 = 216
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by 25:
     \[
     216 \times 25 = 5400
     \]

Thus, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.
