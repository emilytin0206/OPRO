"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Next, multiply the values:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.1 \]
\[ U = 0.05 \, \text{J} \]

Therefore, the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V is:

\(\boxed{0.05 \, \text{J}}\)

So, the correct answer is (C) 0.05 J.",1.0,"Analyze the question in depth, apply relevant principles or calculations where necessary, eliminate incorrect options systematically, and select the most accurate answer based on the given information.",20
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's break down each option and apply relevant principles from electrostatics.

### Given Information:
- A nonconducting sphere with a net electric charge \( +Q \).
- A neutral conducting sphere of the same radius as the nonconducting sphere.
- The nonconducting sphere is brought close to the conducting sphere.

### Analysis:

1. **Option (A): An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
   - When a charged object approaches a conductor, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. This induction causes an electric field within the conductor but does not result in a net charge being stored inside the conductor because conductors can move charges freely to maintain electrical neutrality.
   - Therefore, this statement is true: An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.

2. **Option (B): The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
   - In a conductor, any external electric field causes free electrons to rearrange themselves on the surface but does not result in an overall net charge being stored inside the conductor.
   - Therefore, this statement is false: The conducting sphere will **not** develop a net electric charge of \(-Q\).

3. **Option (C): The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
   - A positively charged nonconducting sphere will induce a negative charge on one side and a positive charge on the other side of the neutral conducting sphere.
   - This induced charge distribution results in an attractive force between the two spheres because opposite charges attract each other.
   - Therefore, this statement is true: The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.

4. **Option (D): The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
   - As explained above, the induced charges on the conducting sphere will result in an attractive force between the two spheres due to opposite charges attracting each other.
   - Therefore, this statement is false: The spheres will not experience an electrostatic repulsion.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the correct statements are (A) and (C). However, since we need to select the most accurate answer based on the given options:

- **Option (A)** correctly identifies that an electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
- **Option (C)** correctly identifies that there will be an electrostatic attraction between the spheres.

Since both are true but only one needs to be selected, and considering the nature of the question which often seeks a single most accurate answer:

The final answer is: **(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**",0.0,"Analyze the question in depth, apply relevant principles or calculations where necessary, eliminate incorrect options systematically, and select the most accurate answer based on the given information.",20
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

### Step 1: Factorize the quadratic expression
First, we factorize the quadratic equation:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

### Step 2: Determine where the factors are zero
Set each factor to zero to find the critical points:
\[ x - 4 = 0 \implies x = 4 \]
\[ x + 1 = 0 \implies x = -1 \]

These points divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 3: Test each interval
We need to determine where the product \((x-4)(x+1)\) is positive. We can test a point in each interval:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \), choose \( x = -2 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]

- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \), choose \( x = 0 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \), choose \( x = 5 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

### Step 4: Combine the results
The expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is satisfied in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 5: Consider the denominator
Since the function includes a square root in the denominator, we must ensure that the expression inside the square root is strictly positive. Therefore, we exclude the points where it equals zero:
\[ x = -1 \text{ and } x = 4 \]

Thus, the domain of \( f(x) \) is all real numbers except \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \).

### Final Answer
The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{(C) (-\infty, -1) U (4, \infty)}

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider principles from constitutional law, specifically related to declaratory judgment actions and the balance between federal and state interests.

### Analysis:

1. **Declaratory Judgment Act (DJA) - 28 U.S.C. § 2201**: This act allows a person ""to have determined any question of construction of an act of Congress, or validity of a statute or regulation under any act of Congress, or validity of the constitutionality of acts of state or local governments.""

2. **Supreme Court Precedents**:
   - **Younger v. Harris (1971)**: This case established that federal courts should not issue injunctions to stop ongoing state criminal proceedings unless there is a showing of irreparable harm and a likelihood of success on the merits.
   - **Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman (1982)**: The Court extended Younger abstention to declaratory judgments, stating that federal courts should not issue declaratory relief if it would interfere with ongoing state proceedings.

3. **Applying the Principles**:
   - **Option A**: This option aligns closely with the principles established in Younger v. Harris and Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman. The law student's action could be seen as interfering with existing state prosecutions, which would likely lead to a dismissal.
   - **Option B**: This is incorrect because it disregards the principle of Younger abstention, which requires that there must be an ongoing or imminent threat of prosecution for declaratory relief to be granted.
   - **Option C**: While this option acknowledges the arrest and warnings as evidence of a genuine threat, it does not address the core issue of whether issuing declaratory relief would interfere with state prosecutions. The law student's companions' arrests do not necessarily mean that the law student himself is threatened with prosecution at the time of filing.
   - **Option D**: This option suggests that the action is premature because the law student’s fears are speculative, but it does not address the interference aspect which is crucial in Younger abstention cases.

### Conclusion:

The most accurate answer based on Supreme Court precedent and principles of declaratory judgment actions is:

**(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**

This option correctly identifies that issuing a declaratory judgment in this case could interfere with ongoing or imminent state proceedings, which aligns with Younger v.

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For the prime factor \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For the prime factor \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For the prime factor \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:
