"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

So, we need to solve:

\[ (x-4)(x+1) > 0 \]

To find where this inequality holds true, we determine the roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the inequality \( (x-4)(x+1) > 0 \) is satisfied in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

Next, we need to ensure that the denominator \( \sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 4} \neq 0 \). This condition is already met by excluding the points where the expression under the square root equals zero, which are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \).

Therefore, combining these results, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider several legal principles related to declaratory judgment actions, particularly as they pertain to federal court jurisdiction and the standards for granting such relief.

1. **Declaratory Judgment Act (DJA) and Federal Court Jurisdiction**: The Declaratory Judgment Act allows parties to seek a declaration of their rights without having an actual controversy or imminent threat of enforcement. However, there must be a genuine case or controversy that would otherwise require the court's intervention.

2. **Supreme Court Precedents on Declaratory Judgments**: In cases like *Warth v. Seldin* (1975), the Supreme Court established criteria for determining whether a declaratory judgment action can proceed, including:
   - A real and immediate threat of enforcement.
   - The existence of a justiciable case or controversy.

3. **Analysis of Options**:

- **Option (A)**: This option suggests that the federal district court would dismiss the action because it interferes with existing state prosecutions. While this is a valid concern, it does not directly address whether there is a genuine threat to the law student.
  
- **Option (B)**: This option states that a federal plaintiff may seek declaratory judgment regardless of imminent prosecution. However, the Supreme Court's criteria for justiciability require more than mere potential future enforcement; there must be an actual and immediate threat.

- **Option (C)**: This option argues that the law student can show a genuine threat based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings. Given the Supreme Court's standards in *Warth v. Seldin*, this seems to align with the requirement of a justiciable case or controversy, as there is evidence of enforcement actions against others.

- **Option (D)**: This option claims that declaratory relief would be premature because the law student’s fears are speculative. While it's true that future threats can sometimes be speculative, the arrest of his companions and prior warnings provide a basis for a genuine threat to the law student.

Considering these points, the most accurate answer is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly identifies that there is a justiciable case or controversy based on the evidence provided, which aligns with Supreme Court precedents regarding declaratory judgment actions.",0.0,"Analyze the given information comprehensively, apply relevant concepts or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options methodically, and select the most accurate answer based on the provided data.",14
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the given scenario.

1. **Nonconducting Sphere with +Q Charge**: This sphere has a net positive charge of +Q. When brought close to another object (in this case, a neutral conducting sphere), it will induce charges on the surface of the conducting sphere due to the electric field created by the nonconducting sphere.

2. **Neutral Conducting Sphere**: A conductor's property is that its free electrons can move freely throughout the material. In response to an external electric field (such as from the +Q charge), these free electrons will rearrange themselves on the surface of the conducting sphere, creating a distribution of charges that counteract the external field.

3. **Induced Charges**: When the nonconducting sphere with +Q is brought close to the neutral conducting sphere, the side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere will develop an induced negative charge (–Q) because the free electrons in the conductor are repelled by the positive charge and move towards the far side. The far side of the conducting sphere will thus have a net positive charge (+Q).

4. **Electrostatic Forces**: 
   - Between the nonconducting sphere with +Q and the induced negative charges on the closest part of the conducting sphere, there is an attractive force.
   - Between the nonconducting sphere with +Q and the induced positive charges on the far side of the conducting sphere, there is a repulsive force.

5. **Net Force**: The net electrostatic force between the two spheres will be attractive because the closer part (with –Q) attracts the +Q charge more strongly than the farther part (with +Q) repels it due to the geometry and the inverse square law of Coulomb's Law.

Now, let’s evaluate each option:

(A) **An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
   - This is true because the nonconducting sphere with a charge +Q creates an electric field that induces charges on the surface of the conducting sphere.

(B) **The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
   - The conducting sphere does not have a net charge; it has induced charges, but these are distributed such that the overall charge remains zero (since free electrons move to one side and leave an equal amount on the other).

(C) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
   - This is true because of the attractive force between the positive charge +Q and the induced negative charge –Q.

(D) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
   - This is false because, as explained above, the net force is attractive due to the closer induced negative charges attracting more strongly than the farther induced positive charges repel.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the most accurate answer is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",0.0,"Analyze the given information comprehensively, apply relevant concepts or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options methodically, and select the most accurate answer based on the provided data.",14
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ E = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( E \) is the energy (work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ E = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

Calculate step by step:
1. Calculate \( V^2 \):
   \[ V^2 = (100 V)^2 = 10000 V^2 \]
2. Multiply the capacitance by \( V^2 \):
   \[ C \times V^2 = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \times 10000 V^2 = 10 \times 10^{-2} J = 0.01 J \]
3. Finally, multiply by \( \frac{1}{2} \):
   \[ E = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.01 J = 0.005 J \]

Therefore, the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V is:

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To determine the minimum positive number of days after which planets X, Y, and Z will be aligned with each other and the sun again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their orbital periods. The given orbital periods are:

- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of these numbers without any remainder.

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:
- \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
- \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
- \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in these factorizations:
- The highest power of 2 is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product step by step:
\[ 2^3 = 8 \]
\[ 3^3 = 27 \]
\[ 5^2 = 25 \]

Next, multiply these together:
\[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
\[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.
