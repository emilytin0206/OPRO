"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, we factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

Next, we determine where this expression is greater than zero by analyzing its roots and sign changes. The roots of the equation are:

\[ x = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -1 \]

These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \). We test a point from each interval to determine where the expression is positive:

- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]

- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Next, we need to ensure that the denominator is not zero. The denominator is \( \sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 4} \), which will be zero when \( x = -1 \) or \( x = 4 \). Therefore, these points must be excluded from the domain.

Combining both conditions (the expression under the square root being positive and the denominator not being zero), we get:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider relevant legal principles, particularly those related to declaratory judgment actions and the standards for obtaining such relief. The key points from Supreme Court precedent that apply here include:

1. **Rooker-Feldman Doctrine**: This doctrine generally prevents federal district courts from hearing cases that are in essence appeals of state court judgments or where a plaintiff seeks to have a state court's decision reviewed by a federal court.

2. **Declaratory Judgment Act (DJA)**: The DJA, 28 U.S.C. § 2201-2202, allows for the issuance of declaratory relief in cases involving actual controversies between parties with adverse legal interests.

3. **Mootness and Ripeness**: These doctrines address whether a case is ripe for judicial review (i.e., whether there has been an actual or imminent injury that can be redressed by the court).

Given these principles, let's analyze each option:

(A) **Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**
- This is not accurate because the law student has not been prosecuted under the state statute; his companions have been arrested, but he seeks a declaratory judgment to avoid future prosecution.

(B) **No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.**
- This statement is generally true and aligns with the principles of the DJA allowing for declaratory relief in cases involving actual controversies.

(C) **No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**
- While this might seem compelling, it does not directly address whether the case is ripe or moot. The law student's companions have already been arrested, but he has not yet faced prosecution.

(D) **Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.**
- This option suggests that the case might be dismissed due to lack of immediacy or certainty in the threat of enforcement against the law student himself.

Considering these points and Supreme Court precedent, particularly the need for an actual controversy and the ripeness of the claim, the most accurate answer is:

**(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.**

This option correctly reflects that the law student can still seek declaratory relief based on his fear of future enforcement actions against him, as evidenced by the prior warnings and arrests of his companions.",0.0,"Analyze the given information meticulously, apply relevant theories or calculations as necessary, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",10
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

Calculate step by step:
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-2} J \]
\[ U = 0.05 J \]

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the given scenario.

1. **Nonconducting Sphere with +Q Charge**: This sphere has a net positive charge of +Q. When brought close to another object (in this case, a neutral conducting sphere), it will induce charges on the surface of the conducting sphere due to the electric field created by the nonconducting sphere.

2. **Conducting Sphere Initially Neutral**: A conducting sphere initially has no net charge. However, when placed in an electric field, free electrons within the conductor can move and rearrange themselves to counteract the external field as much as possible.

3. **Induced Charges on Conducting Sphere**:
   - When a positive charge is brought close to one side of a neutral conducting sphere, the electrons in the conductor will be repelled by the positive charge and move towards the opposite side.
   - This movement of charges results in an induced negative charge on the side closest to the nonconducting sphere and an induced positive charge on the far side.

4. **Electrostatic Forces**:
   - The induced negative charge on the side of the conducting sphere nearest to the nonconducting sphere will experience a repulsive force from the +Q charge.
   - The induced positive charge on the opposite side of the conducting sphere will experience an attractive force towards the +Q charge.

5. **Net Electrostatic Force Between Spheres**:
   - Since the net charge on the conducting sphere is not zero (it has both positive and negative charges, but these are distributed such that the overall effect is a net attraction), there will be an electrostatic attraction between the two spheres.

Now let's evaluate each option:

(A) **An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
   - This statement is true because the nonconducting sphere creates an electric field, which induces charges in the conducting sphere. However, this alone does not fully describe the interaction or the net effect between the spheres.

(B) **The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
   - This is incorrect because while there are induced negative and positive charges on the conducting sphere, they do not sum up to a net charge of –Q; instead, they balance out in such a way that the overall effect is an attraction.

(C) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
   - This statement accurately describes the interaction between the two spheres due to the induced charges and their respective electric fields.

(D) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
   - This is incorrect because, as explained above, there will be a net attractive force due to the induced charges on the conducting sphere.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",0.0,"Analyze the given information meticulously, apply relevant theories or calculations as necessary, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",10
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

\[ 2^3 = 8 \]
\[ 3^3 = 27 \]
\[ 5^2 = 25 \]

Multiplying these together:
\[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
\[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.
