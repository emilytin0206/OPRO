"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, determine where this product is greater than zero. The roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \) are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero and we have already ensured that it is positive in these intervals, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the given scenario.

1. **Nonconducting Sphere with +Q Charge**: A nonconducting sphere that has a net positive charge \(+Q\) means that it has more protons than electrons within its material structure.

2. **Neutral Conducting Sphere**: The conducting sphere is initially neutral, meaning it has an equal number of protons and electrons, resulting in no net electric charge overall.

3. **Induced Charges on the Conducting Sphere**:
   - When a nonconducting charged object (in this case, the +Q sphere) approaches a conductor, it induces charges within the conductor due to the principle of electrostatic induction.
   - The side of the conducting sphere closest to the positively charged nonconducting sphere will experience an attractive force from the positive charge. This attraction causes electrons in the conductor to be pushed away from this region towards the opposite (farther) side of the conductor.

4. **Charge Distribution**:
   - As a result, the side of the conducting sphere nearest to the +Q sphere will develop a net negative charge due to the excess of electrons.
   - The far side of the conducting sphere will have an induced positive charge as it is now closer to having more protons than electrons.

5. **Electrostatic Forces**:
   - The electrostatic force between two charges follows Coulomb's law, which states that opposite charges attract and like charges repel.
   - Therefore, the negative charge on one side of the conducting sphere will be attracted to the positive charge \(+Q\) of the nonconducting sphere. This attraction results in an overall attractive force between the spheres.

Now let's evaluate each option:

(A) **An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere**:
   - Yes, this is true because the presence of a charged object near a conductor induces charges on the surface of the conductor, creating an internal electric field that redistributes the charge to minimize potential energy.

(B) **The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q**:
   - This statement is incorrect. The induced negative charge on one side of the conducting sphere does not result in a net overall charge for the entire sphere because charges are free to move within the conductor, and they will rearrange themselves until the potential throughout the conductor is uniform.

(C) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction**:
   - This statement is correct. The induced negative charge on one side of the conducting sphere attracts the positive charge \(+Q\) from the nonconducting sphere.

(D) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion**:
   - This statement is incorrect because there are no like charges between the two spheres that would result in a repulsive force. The only significant interaction is the attractive force due to opposite charges.

Therefore, based on the analysis and principles of electrostatics, the most accurate answer is:

**(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**",0.0,"Analyze the question in depth, consider relevant principles or calculations as necessary, eliminate incorrect options, and select the most accurate answer based on the provided information.",18
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To analyze this question accurately, we need to consider principles from constitutional law, specifically related to declaratory judgment actions and the balance between federal and state interests.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a legal remedy that allows a court to formally declare the rights of parties without ordering any specific action or awarding damages. The primary purpose is to resolve legal uncertainties before they lead to actual disputes.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent and Principles**:
   - **Equity and Comity**: Federal courts generally avoid issuing declaratory judgments that would interfere with ongoing state prosecutions, as this could be seen as an improper interference in the state's judicial process.
   - **Mootness and Ripeness**: A case is considered moot if it no longer presents a live controversy. It must also be ripe for review, meaning there should be a concrete threat of enforcement against the plaintiff.

3. **Analysis of Each Option**:
   - **(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**
     - This option suggests that the federal court will dismiss the action because it might interfere with ongoing state proceedings. However, this reasoning is not entirely accurate as the law student has already been warned and his companions have been arrested.
   - **(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.**
     - This option is incorrect because the law student's situation involves an actual threat of enforcement against him due to prior warnings and his companions' arrest.
   - **(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**
     - This option is correct. The law student has shown that he faces a real risk of being arrested based on similar conduct to what his friends were arrested for.
   - **(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.**
     - This option is incorrect as the law student has concrete evidence that he could face enforcement actions.

**Conclusion**: The most accurate answer based on Supreme Court precedent and principles is **(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This conclusion aligns with the principle that a declaratory judgment may be granted when there is a concrete threat of enforcement, which in this case, is supported by the evidence provided.",0.0,"Analyze the question in depth, consider relevant principles or calculations as necessary, eliminate incorrect options, and select the most accurate answer based on the provided information.",18
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:
