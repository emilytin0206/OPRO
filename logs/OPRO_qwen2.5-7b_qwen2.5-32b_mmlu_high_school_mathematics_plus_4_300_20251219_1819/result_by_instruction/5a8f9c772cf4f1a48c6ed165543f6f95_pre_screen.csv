"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider principles from constitutional law, specifically related to declaratory judgment actions and the balance between federal and state interests.

### Analysis:

1. **Declaratory Judgment Act (28 U.S.C. § 2201-2202):** This act allows a person ""to have determined any question of construction or validity"" of a statute, treaty, or constitutional provision. However, the Supreme Court has established certain limitations on when such actions can be brought.

2. **Supreme Court Precedents:**
   - **Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Co., 421 U.S. 723 (1975):** The Court held that declaratory relief is not available where the plaintiff seeks to avoid a state prosecution, as it would interfere with the state's sovereign interest in enforcing its laws.
   - **Pennhurst State School & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89 (1984):** The Court emphasized that declaratory relief should not be granted if it would disrupt ongoing state proceedings or prosecutions.

3. **Applying the Precedents:**
   - In this case, the law student is seeking a declaratory judgment to avoid potential future prosecution under criminal trespass and loitering statutes.
   - The arrest of his companions and prior warnings indicate that there is a genuine threat of enforcement against him as well.

### Evaluating Each Option:

- **(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**
  - This option aligns closely with Blue Chip Stamps, which specifically addresses interference with ongoing state proceedings.
  
- **(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.**
  - This option does not consider the specific circumstances of the case and the potential for disruption to state prosecutions.

- **(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**
  - While this statement is true, it does not address whether seeking declaratory relief would interfere with existing state proceedings or prosecutions.

- **(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.**
  - This option suggests that the fear of future prosecution is too speculative to justify immediate declaratory relief, but it does not consider the specific circumstances and potential for disruption.

### Conclusion:

Given the Supreme Court precedent in Blue Chip Stamps, which directly addresses interference with state prosecutions, the most accurate answer is:

**(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**",0.0,"Analyze the question in depth, apply relevant principles or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options systematically, and choose the most accurate answer based on the provided information.",20
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

First, calculate \( V^2 \):

\[ V^2 = (100 V)^2 = 10000 V^2 \]

Now substitute this back into the equation:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} J \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 J \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 0.005 J.",0.0,"Analyze the question in depth, apply relevant principles or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options systematically, and choose the most accurate answer based on the provided information.",20
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

### Step 1: Factorize the quadratic expression
First, we factorize the quadratic equation:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

### Step 2: Determine where the factors are zero
Set each factor to zero to find the critical points:
\[ x - 4 = 0 \implies x = 4 \]
\[ x + 1 = 0 \implies x = -1 \]

These points divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 3: Test each interval
We need to determine where the product \((x-4)(x+1)\) is positive. We can test a point in each interval:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \), choose \( x = -2 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]

- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \), choose \( x = 0 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \), choose \( x = 5 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

### Step 4: Combine the results
The expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is satisfied in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 5: Consider the denominator
Since the function includes a square root in the denominator, we must ensure that the expression inside the square root is strictly positive. Therefore, we exclude the points where it equals zero:
\[ x = -1 \text{ and } x = 4 \]

Thus, the domain of \( f(x) \) is all real numbers except \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \).

### Final Answer
The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{(C) (-\infty, -1) U (4, \infty)}

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's break down each option and apply relevant principles from electrostatics.

### Given Information:
- A nonconducting sphere with a net electric charge \( +Q \).
- A neutral conducting sphere of the same radius as the nonconducting sphere.
- The nonconducting sphere is brought close to the conducting sphere.

### Analysis:

1. **Option (A): An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
   - When a charged object approaches a conductor, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. These induced charges rearrange themselves such that the electric field inside the conductor remains zero.
   - This is due to the free electrons in the conductor being able to move and redistribute themselves in response to the external electric field.

2. **Option (B): The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
   - A neutral conducting sphere cannot have a net charge; it must remain electrically neutral after induction.
   - However, there can be induced charges on its surface, but these do not add up to a net charge.

3. **Option (C): The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
   - An object with a positive charge (+Q) will induce a negative charge on the side of the conducting sphere facing it and a positive charge on the opposite side.
   - This induced negative charge on the near side of the conducting sphere will attract the nonconducting sphere.

4. **Option (D): The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
   - Since one sphere is positively charged (+Q) and the other has an induced negative charge, there should be an attractive force between them, not a repulsive one.
   - Repulsion would occur if both objects had like charges.

### Conclusion:
- Option (A) is correct because an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere due to the presence of the charged nonconducting sphere.
- Option (B) is incorrect as the net charge on the conducting sphere remains zero after induction.
- Option (C) is correct in terms of the nature of the force, but it does not directly answer what happens inside the conducting sphere.
- Option (D) is incorrect because there will be an attractive force between the spheres.

The best answer is **(A)**: An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.",0.0,"Analyze the question in depth, apply relevant principles or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options systematically, and choose the most accurate answer based on the provided information.",20
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For the prime factor \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For the prime factor \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For the prime factor \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:
