"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding the Initial Setup**:
   - We have a nonconducting sphere with a net electric charge +Q.
   - A neutral conducting sphere of the same radius is brought close to the charged nonconducting sphere.

2. **Electric Field and Induction in Conductors**:
   - When a charged object (in this case, the nonconducting sphere) approaches a conductor, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor.
   - In a conductor, free electrons can move freely under the influence of an electric field. The presence of the external charge will cause these free electrons to redistribute themselves in such a way as to cancel out the external field inside the conductor.

3. **Induced Charges**:
   - Since the nonconducting sphere has a positive charge +Q, it will induce negative charges on the side of the conducting sphere that is closest to it and positive charges on the opposite side.
   - This induced charge distribution ensures that the electric field inside the conductor remains zero.

4. **Net Charge on the Conducting Sphere**:
   - The net charge on the conducting sphere does not change because the total charge must be conserved. However, there will be a redistribution of charges such that the conducting sphere develops an equal and opposite induced charge to the side closest to the nonconducting sphere.

5. **Electrostatic Forces Between the Spheres**:
   - The positive charge on the nonconducting sphere will attract the negative charges on the conducting sphere.
   - Similarly, the negative charges on the conducting sphere (induced by the nonconducting sphere) will repel the positive charges on the nonconducting sphere.

6. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere**: This is true because of the redistribution of charges, but it's not the most direct answer to what happens between the spheres.
   - **(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q**: This is incorrect. The total charge on the conducting sphere remains zero (since no charge was added or removed from it), but there are induced charges that balance out the external field inside the conductor.
   - **(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction**: This is partially true because the positive and negative charges do attract each other, but this does not fully capture the repulsive forces between like charges on the nonconducting sphere.
   - **(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion**: This is also true due to the repulsion of like charges (positive on the nonconducting sphere and induced negative charges on the conducting sphere).

Given these considerations, the most accurate answer that directly addresses the interaction between the two spheres is:

**(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**

However, it's important to note that there is also repulsion due to like charges, but the primary force described in option (C) captures the dominant attractive force.

Therefore, the final answer is **(C)**.",1.0,"Analyze the problem statement in depth, apply relevant theories or calculations as required, eliminate incorrect options systematically based on provided information, and select the most accurate answer from those given.",10
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Next, multiply the values:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.1 \]
\[ U = 0.05 \, \text{J} \]

Therefore, the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V is:

\(\boxed{0.05 \, \text{J}}\)

So, the correct answer is (C) 0.05 J.",1.0,"Analyze the problem statement in depth, apply relevant theories or calculations as required, eliminate incorrect options systematically based on provided information, and select the most accurate answer from those given.",10
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To analyze this problem statement in depth, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly as they relate to federal court jurisdiction and the standards for granting such relief. The key points to examine include:

1. **Nature of Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a lawsuit brought by one party seeking a declaration from a court regarding their rights or obligations under a specific set of circumstances.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent on Declaratory Judgments**: The Supreme Court has established that federal courts have the authority to grant declaratory relief, but this power must be exercised with caution to avoid interfering with state prosecutions and to ensure that there is a genuine threat of enforcement against the plaintiff.

3. **Requirements for Granting Declaratory Relief**:
   - There must be an actual controversy or a ""case or controversy"" as required by Article III of the U.S. Constitution.
   - The party seeking declaratory relief must have standing, which means they must show that they are in a legal relationship with another party and that there is a real and immediate threat of enforcement against them.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option (A)**: This option suggests that the federal district court would dismiss the action because it interferes with existing state prosecutions. While this might be a valid concern, Supreme Court precedent does not uniformly support dismissing such actions solely based on interference with state prosecutions.
   - **Option (B)**: This option states that a federal plaintiff may seek declaratory judgment even if they are not directly threatened by a state prosecution. However, the law student's case involves prior warnings and an arrest of his companions, which could be seen as creating a genuine threat to him.
   - **Option (C)**: This option argues that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on the arrest of his companions and previous warnings. Given these facts, this seems like a strong argument for granting declaratory relief.
   - **Option (D)**: This option suggests that the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears are speculative. However, given the concrete actions taken by the police against his friends, it can be argued that there is a real and immediate threat to him.

Based on these considerations, the most accurate answer is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option aligns with the legal principles that require a showing of a genuine threat for declaratory relief to be granted, which in this case appears to be present due to the actions taken against the law student's friends and the previous warnings from the police.",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement in depth, apply relevant theories or calculations as required, eliminate incorrect options systematically based on provided information, and select the most accurate answer from those given.",10
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

### Step 1: Factorize the quadratic expression
First, we factorize the quadratic equation:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

### Step 2: Determine where the factors are zero
Set each factor to zero to find the critical points:
\[ x - 4 = 0 \implies x = 4 \]
\[ x + 1 = 0 \implies x = -1 \]

These points divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 3: Test each interval
We need to determine where the product \((x-4)(x+1)\) is positive. We can test a point in each interval:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \), choose \( x = -2 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]

- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \), choose \( x = 0 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \), choose \( x = 5 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

### Step 4: Combine the results
The expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \) is positive in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 5: Consider the denominator
Since the function includes a square root in the denominator, we must ensure that the expression inside the square root is strictly greater than zero. Therefore, we exclude the points where it equals zero:
\[ x = -1 \text{ and } x = 4 \]

Thus, the domain of \( f(x) \) is the union of the intervals where the expression is positive:
\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

### Conclusion
The correct answer is:

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers without any remainder.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Identify the Highest Powers of Each Prime**:
   - For \(2\): The highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\): The highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\): The highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

3. **Calculate the LCM**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2
   \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     - \(2^3 = 8\)
     - \(3^3 = 27\)
     - \(5^2 = 25\)

4. **Multiply the Results**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 8 \times 27 \times 25
   \]
   - First, multiply 8 and 27:
     \[
     8 \times 27 = 216
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by 25:
     \[
     216 \times 25 = 5400
     \]

Thus, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.
