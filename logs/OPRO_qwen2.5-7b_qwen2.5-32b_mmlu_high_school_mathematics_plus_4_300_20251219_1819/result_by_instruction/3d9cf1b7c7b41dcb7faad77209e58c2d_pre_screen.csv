"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the given scenario.

### Analysis:

1. **Nonconducting Sphere with +Q Charge**:
   - A nonconducting sphere has a net positive charge \(+Q\). This means that there are more positively charged particles than negatively charged ones within it, leading to an overall positive electric field around it.

2. **Neutral Conducting Sphere**:
   - The conducting sphere is initially neutral, meaning the total number of positive and negative charges inside the conductor is balanced (net charge = 0).

3. **Induced Charges in a Conductor**:
   - When a charged object approaches a conductor, an induced charge distribution occurs on the surface of the conductor. This happens because free electrons within the conductor can move to redistribute themselves in response to the external electric field.

4. **Electric Field and Induction**:
   - The presence of the positively charged nonconducting sphere will create an electric field around it. When this field approaches the neutral conducting sphere, the free electrons on the surface of the conducting sphere will be displaced by the external electric field.
   - On one side of the conductor closest to the nonconducting sphere, there will be a concentration of positive charges (since negative charges move away), and on the opposite side, there will be an excess of negative charges.

### Evaluating Each Option:

- **(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
  - This is true because when a charged object approaches a conductor, it induces a charge distribution that creates an internal electric field to counteract the external field. However, this does not directly answer what happens between the two spheres.

- **(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
  - This is incorrect because the total charge on the conducting sphere remains zero due to the redistribution of charges (not an overall change in net charge).

- **(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
  - This is true. The induced positive charges on one side of the conducting sphere and the induced negative charges on the other side create a dipole-like configuration that results in an attractive force between the two spheres.

- **(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
  - This is incorrect because there are no like charges (both spheres do not have net positive or net negative charges). Therefore, they cannot repel each other based on their induced charges.

### Conclusion:

The most accurate answer is:
**(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**

This conclusion aligns with the principles of electrostatic induction and the resulting dipole-like configuration between the two spheres.",0.0,"Analyze the question deeply, use relevant theories or calculations to evaluate each option, eliminate those that do not align with the given information, and select the most accurate answer.",19
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider relevant legal principles, particularly those established by the U.S. Supreme Court regarding declaratory judgment actions and their relationship with state prosecutions.

### Analysis:

1. **Option (A):** This option suggests that the federal district court would dismiss the action because it interferes with existing state prosecutions. The doctrine of ""equity and comity"" is often invoked in such cases, but this is not a blanket rule. It's more about whether the declaratory judgment would interfere significantly with ongoing or imminent state proceedings.

2. **Option (B):** This option states that a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not directly threatened by a state prosecution on the statute in question. While this might be true, it doesn't address the specific circumstances of the case where there are existing arrests and warnings.

3. **Option (C):** This option argues that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on the arrest of his companions and prior warnings. The Supreme Court has recognized that declaratory judgments may be granted when there is a ""genuine"" or ""real and immediate"" threat of enforcement, even if no prosecution has yet occurred.

4. **Option (D):** This option claims that the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears are speculative. However, the Supreme Court has allowed declaratory judgments in cases where there is a substantial risk of future enforcement, as evidenced by prior warnings and arrests.

### Relevant Legal Precedent:

- **O'Shea v. Littleton (1986):** The Supreme Court held that a plaintiff must show a ""real and immediate"" threat of enforcement to obtain declaratory relief.
- **Warth v. Seldin (1975):** This case established the requirement for plaintiffs to demonstrate a ""personal stake in the outcome"" to bring a suit, which aligns with showing a genuine threat.

### Conclusion:

Given that the law student's companions have already been arrested and he has received warnings, there is a clear indication of a real and immediate threat. The Supreme Court precedent supports granting declaratory relief when such a threat exists.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**",1.0,"Analyze the question deeply, use relevant theories or calculations to evaluate each option, eliminate those that do not align with the given information, and select the most accurate answer.",19
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

### Step 1: Factorize the quadratic expression
The quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0 \) can be factored as:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

### Step 2: Determine where the factors are zero
Set each factor to zero to find the critical points:
\[ x - 4 = 0 \implies x = 4 \]
\[ x + 1 = 0 \implies x = -1 \]

These points divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 3: Test each interval
We need to determine where the product \((x-4)(x+1)\) is positive. We can test a point in each interval:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \), choose \( x = -2 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]

- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \), choose \( x = 0 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \), choose \( x = 5 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

### Step 4: Combine the results
The expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is satisfied in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 5: Consider the denominator
Since the function has a square root in the denominator, we must ensure that the expression inside the square root is strictly positive. Therefore, we exclude the points where it equals zero:
\[ x = -1 \text{ and } x = 4 \]

Thus, the domain of \( f(x) \) is the union of the intervals where the expression under the square root is positive:
\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

### Conclusion
The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{C} \]",1.0,"Analyze the question deeply, use relevant theories or calculations to evaluate each option, eliminate those that do not align with the given information, and select the most accurate answer.",19
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

First, calculate \( V^2 \):

\[ V^2 = (100 V)^2 = 10000 V^2 \]

Now substitute this back into the equation:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} J \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 J \]

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers without any remainder.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Identify the Highest Powers of Each Prime**:
   - For \(2\): The highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\): The highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\): The highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

3. **Calculate the LCM**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2
   \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     - \(2^3 = 8\)
     - \(3^3 = 27\)
     - \(5^2 = 25\)

4. **Multiply the Results**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 8 \times 27 \times 25
   \]
   - First, multiply 8 and 27:
     \[
     8 \times 27 = 216
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by 25:
     \[
     216 \times 25 = 5400
     \]

Thus, the least common multiple of 360, 450, and 540 is 5400.

The minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \( \boxed{5400} \).",0.0,"Analyze the question deeply, use relevant theories or calculations to evaluate each option, eliminate those that do not align with the given information, and select the most accurate answer.",19
