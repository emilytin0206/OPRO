"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the numerator and the denominator are defined. Specifically, for the square root in the denominator, the expression inside must be positive because the square root of a negative number is not real, and division by zero is undefined.

Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. **Identify where the denominator is defined:**
   The denominator is \(\sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 4}\). For the expression under the square root to be defined (and positive), we need:
   \[
   x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0
   \]

2. **Solve the inequality \(x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0\):**
   First, solve the equation \(x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0\) to find the critical points.
   \[
   x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) = 0
   \]
   So, the roots are:
   \[
   x = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -1
   \]

3. **Determine the intervals where \(x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0\):**
   The critical points divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -1)\), \((-1, 4)\), and \((4, \infty)\). We test a point in each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

   - For \(x \in (-\infty, -1)\):
     Choose \(x = -2\):
     \[
     (-2)^2 - 3(-2) - 4 = 4 + 6 - 4 = 6 > 0
     \]
     So, the inequality holds in \((-\infty, -1)\).

   - For \(x \in (-1, 4)\):
     Choose \(x = 0\):
     \[
     0^2 - 3(0) - 4 = -4 < 0
     \]
     So, the inequality does not hold in \((-1, 4)\).

   - For \(x \in (4, \infty)\):
     Choose \(x = 5\):
     \[
     5^2 - 3(5) - 4 = 25 - 15 - 4 = 6 > 0
     \]
     So, the inequality holds in \((4, \infty)\).

4. **Combine the intervals where the inequality is satisfied:**
   The expression \(x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0\) is true for:
   \[
   x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty)
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   Therefore, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:
   \[
   (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty)
   \]

Thus, the correct answer is:
\[

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To analyze this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedents and the specific circumstances presented.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that clarifies or declares the rights of parties without ordering any action or awarding damages. The primary purpose is to resolve legal uncertainties before they lead to actual disputes.

2. **Supreme Court Precedents on Declaratory Judgments**:
   - In *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club* (1973), the Supreme Court held that a declaratory judgment action can be brought even if there is no immediate threat of prosecution, as long as the plaintiff has standing and the case involves a genuine controversy.
   - In *Warth v. Seldin* (1975), the Court established criteria for determining whether a party has standing to bring a declaratory judgment action, including a real and immediate threat of enforcement.

3. **Applying the Facts**:
   - The law student is seeking an advance ruling on the constitutionality of criminal statutes.
   - His companions were arrested for criminal trespass and loitering after continuing their protest despite warnings.
   - The law student was warned but left to avoid arrest, indicating a genuine threat of enforcement against him.

4. **Analyzing Each Option**:
   - **Option (A)**: This option suggests that the declaratory relief would be dismissed due to interference with existing state prosecutions and equity/comity concerns. However, Supreme Court precedents like *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club* do not support this blanket dismissal.
   - **Option (B)**: This is incorrect because it ignores the need for a genuine threat of enforcement against the plaintiff.
   - **Option (C)**: This option correctly identifies that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings. This aligns with *Warth v. Seldin* criteria.
   - **Option (D)**: While it mentions prematurity, it incorrectly dismisses the possibility of a genuine threat against the plaintiff.

Given these considerations, the most accurate answer is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's break down the scenario and apply relevant principles from electrostatics.

### Scenario Analysis:
- **Nonconducting Sphere**: Initially given a net electric charge of +Q. This means it has more positive charges than negative ones.
- **Neutral Conducting Sphere**: Initially neutral (equal amounts of positive and negative charges, resulting in no net charge).

When the nonconducting sphere with a net charge +Q is brought close to the neutral conducting sphere:

1. **Induced Charges on the Conducting Sphere**:
   - The presence of the charged nonconducting sphere will induce an electric field around it.
   - In response to this external electric field, charges in the conducting sphere will rearrange themselves due to the principle of electrostatic induction.

2. **Charge Distribution**:
   - On the side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere with +Q charge, negative charges (electrons) will be pushed towards that surface.
   - On the opposite side of the conducting sphere, positive charges will be concentrated there due to the repulsion from the induced negative charges.

3. **Net Charge on Conducting Sphere**:
   - The conducting sphere remains electrically neutral overall because the total number of electrons and protons in it is still balanced.
   - However, a temporary separation of charges occurs, creating an internal charge distribution but no net external charge change.

4. **Electrostatic Forces Between Spheres**:
   - The induced negative charges on one side of the conducting sphere will experience an attractive force towards the positive charge +Q from the nonconducting sphere.
   - Similarly, the induced positive charges on the opposite side of the conducting sphere will experience a repulsive force away from the positive charge +Q.

### Evaluating the Options:
- **(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
  - This is true because the external electric field from the nonconducting sphere induces a rearrangement of charges in the conducting sphere, creating an internal electric field.
  
- **(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
  - This is incorrect because the total charge on the conducting sphere remains zero due to its ability to redistribute charges without changing the overall balance.

- **(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
  - This is true because the induced negative charges on one side of the conducting sphere are attracted towards the positive charge +Q, and this attractive force dominates over any repulsive forces from the other side.
  
- **(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
  - This is incorrect because while there might be some repulsive forces due to induced charges on opposite sides of the conducting sphere, the overall dominant force between the two spheres is attractive.

### Conclusion:
The most accurate answer based on the analysis and principles of electrostatics is:

**(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**",0.0,"Analyze the question in depth, apply relevant theories or calculations, eliminate incorrect options based on provided information, and select the most accurate answer.",18
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers without any remainder.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Identify the Highest Powers of Each Prime**:
   - For \(2\): The highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\): The highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\): The highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

3. **Calculate the LCM**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2
   \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     - \(2^3 = 8\)
     - \(3^3 = 27\)
     - \(5^2 = 25\)

4. **Multiply the Results**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 8 \times 27 \times 25
   \]
   - First, multiply 8 and 27:
     \[
     8 \times 27 = 216
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by 25:
     \[
     216 \times 25 = 5400
     \]

Thus, the least common multiple of 360, 450, and 540 is 5400.

### Conclusion:

The minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,"Analyze the question in depth, apply relevant theories or calculations, eliminate incorrect options based on provided information, and select the most accurate answer.",18
