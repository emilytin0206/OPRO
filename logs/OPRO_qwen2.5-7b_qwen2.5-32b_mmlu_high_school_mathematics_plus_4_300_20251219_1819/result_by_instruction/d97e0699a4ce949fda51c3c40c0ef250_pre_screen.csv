"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's break down the scenario and apply relevant principles from electrostatics.

1. **Initial Setup**: We have a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius.

2. **Electric Field Induction in Conductors**:
   - When a charged object is placed near a conductor, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. The induced charges rearrange themselves such that the electric field inside the conductor remains zero.
   
3. **Induced Charges on the Conducting Sphere**:
   - Since the nonconducting sphere has a positive charge +Q, it will induce an equal and opposite negative charge –Q on one side of the conducting sphere and a corresponding positive charge +Q on the other side to maintain electrical neutrality overall but with induced charges.

4. **Electrostatic Forces Between Spheres**:
   - The electrostatic force between two charged objects is given by Coulomb's law: \( F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \), where \(k\) is Coulomb’s constant, \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) are the charges, and \(r\) is the distance between them.
   - The nonconducting sphere has a net charge +Q. The conducting sphere will have an induced –Q on one side (closer to the nonconducting sphere) and +Q on the other side.

5. **Net Force Calculation**:
   - The force exerted by the nonconducting sphere with charge +Q on the part of the conducting sphere that has a charge –Q is attractive.
   - The force exerted by the nonconducting sphere with charge +Q on the part of the conducting sphere that has a charge +Q is repulsive.

6. **Net Electrostatic Force**:
   - Since the charges are distributed such that there's an equal and opposite charge on one side, the net electrostatic force between the two spheres will be attractive due to the closer interaction with the –Q charge.

Now let’s evaluate each option:

- (A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
  - This is true because a nonconducting sphere with +Q charge will induce charges on the conducting sphere, but this does not directly answer the question about forces or net charge.

- (B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
  - This is incorrect. While there will be an induced –Q charge on one side and +Q on the other, the overall net charge of the conducting sphere remains zero due to its ability to redistribute charges to maintain neutrality.

- (C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
  - This is correct based on the analysis above; the attractive force between the positive charge of the nonconducting sphere and the induced negative charge on the conducting sphere's side closer to it.

- (D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.
  - This is incorrect because, as explained, the net force due to the induced charges results in attraction rather than repulsion.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is:

**(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**",0.0,"Analyze the provided information or question in depth, apply relevant theories or calculations as necessary, eliminate incorrect options logically based on the given context, and select the most accurate answer from those available.",6
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

First, calculate \( V^2 \):

\[ V^2 = (100 V)^2 = 10000 V^2 \]

Now substitute this back into the equation:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} J \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 J \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 0.005 J.",0.0,"Analyze the provided information or question in depth, apply relevant theories or calculations as necessary, eliminate incorrect options logically based on the given context, and select the most accurate answer from those available.",6
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedent. The key points to analyze include:

1. **Nature of Declaratory Judgment**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that determines the rights and obligations between parties without ordering any specific action or awarding damages.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent**: The most relevant case here is likely *O'Shea v. Littleton* (414 U.S. 488, 1974), where the Supreme Court established that a declaratory judgment should not be granted if there is no actual or imminent controversy between the parties.

3. **Equity and Comity**: The doctrine of equity and comity suggests that courts should avoid interfering with ongoing state prosecutions unless absolutely necessary to prevent injustice.

Now, let's analyze each option:

(A) **Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**
- This option aligns with *O'Shea v. Littleton*, which emphasized that a declaratory judgment should not be granted if it interferes with ongoing state proceedings.

(B) **No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.**
- This option does not consider the specific circumstances of the case and the potential for interference in existing prosecutions.

(C) **No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**
- While this might seem plausible, it doesn't address whether granting declaratory relief would interfere with ongoing state proceedings or be premature due to speculative fears.

(D) **Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.**
- This option correctly identifies that the law student’s fears are speculative and not imminent enough to justify a declaratory judgment under *O'Shea v. Littleton*.

Given these considerations, the most accurate answer is:

**(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.**

This option correctly applies Supreme Court precedent and addresses the speculative nature of the law student’s fears without interfering with ongoing state prosecutions.",0.0,"Analyze the provided information or question in depth, apply relevant theories or calculations as necessary, eliminate incorrect options logically based on the given context, and select the most accurate answer from those available.",6
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the numerator and the denominator are defined. Specifically, for the square root in the denominator, the expression inside must be positive because the square root of a negative number is not real, and division by zero is undefined.

Let's analyze the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

1. **Factorize the quadratic expression:**
   The quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0 \) can be factored as:
   \[
   (x-4)(x+1) = 0
   \]
   So, the roots are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \).

2. **Determine the intervals:**
   The roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \). We need to test each interval to see where the expression is positive.

3. **Test points in each interval:**
   - For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \).
     \[
     (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0
     \]
   - For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \).
     \[
     (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0
     \]
   - For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \).
     \[
     (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0
     \]

From the tests, we see that \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

Therefore, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:
\[
(-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty)

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the numbers without any remainder.

The given orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Identify the Highest Powers of Each Prime**:
   - For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

3. **Calculate LCM**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2
   \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     - \(2^3 = 8\)
     - \(3^3 = 27\)
     - \(5^2 = 25\)

4. **Multiply the Results**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 8 \times 27 \times 25
   \]
   - First, multiply 8 and 27:
     \[
     8 \times 27 = 216
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by 25:
     \[
     216 \times 25 = 5400
     \]

Thus, the least common multiple of 360, 450, and 540 is 5400.

### Conclusion:

The minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,"Analyze the provided information or question in depth, apply relevant theories or calculations as necessary, eliminate incorrect options logically based on the given context, and select the most accurate answer from those available.",6
