"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (work required),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 0.005 J.",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement meticulously, apply necessary theories or calculations, eliminate incorrect options based on given information, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",9
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Setup**: We have two spheres - one nonconducting sphere with a net electric charge +Q and a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius.

2. **Electric Field Induction in Conductors**:
   - When a charged object is brought close to a conductor, an induced charge will appear on the surface of the conductor. This induced charge will be such that it opposes the external field at the surface of the conductor.
   
3. **Induced Charges and Net Charge**:
   - The nonconducting sphere has a net positive charge +Q. When this charged sphere is brought close to the neutral conducting sphere, an electric field will be created around the nonconducting sphere.
   - This external electric field will induce charges on the surface of the conducting sphere. Specifically, the side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere will develop a negative charge (induced by the positive charge), and the opposite side will develop a positive charge.

4. **Net Charge on Conducting Sphere**:
   - The conducting sphere is initially neutral but after induction, it will not have a net electric charge of –Q because the induced charges are distributed in such a way that they cancel each other out overall. However, there will be an imbalance at the surface due to the proximity effect.

5. **Electrostatic Forces**:
   - The electrostatic force between two charged objects is given by Coulomb's law: \( F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \), where \(k\) is Coulomb’s constant, \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) are the charges, and \(r\) is the distance between them.
   - Since one sphere has a net positive charge +Q and the other will have an induced negative charge on its side facing the nonconducting sphere (and possibly some positive charge on the opposite side), there will be an attractive force between the two spheres.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude:

- **Option A**: An electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere due to the external electric field from the charged nonconducting sphere.
- **Option B**: The conducting sphere will not develop a net charge of –Q; instead, it will have an induced charge distribution with some negative and positive charges.
- **Option C**: The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction because of the induced charges on the surface of the conducting sphere.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**",1.0,"Analyze the problem statement meticulously, apply necessary theories or calculations, eliminate incorrect options based on given information, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",9
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, we factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

So, the inequality becomes:

\[ (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \]

To solve this inequality, we find the roots of the equation \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the inequality \( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \) holds for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Next, we need to ensure that the denominator is not zero. The expression under the square root must be strictly greater than zero, so there are no additional restrictions from this part.

Therefore, combining these results, the domain of \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

So, the correct answer is:

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To analyze this problem statement meticulously, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedent and the specific circumstances presented.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that determines the rights of parties without ordering any action or providing relief. The primary purpose is to resolve legal disputes before they lead to more serious consequences like criminal prosecution.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent and Declaratory Judgments**: In cases such as *Warth v. Seldin* (1975), the Supreme Court established criteria for declaratory judgment actions, including a genuine threat of enforcement against the plaintiff. The Court emphasized that there must be an actual controversy to justify the issuance of a declaratory judgment.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: This option suggests that the federal district court would dismiss the action because it interferes with existing state prosecutions and is disallowed for reasons of equity and comity. While this might seem plausible, Supreme Court precedent does not support dismissing such actions solely based on interference with state prosecutions.
   
   - **Option B**: This option states that a federal plaintiff may seek declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute. However, the Supreme Court's criteria for declaratory judgments require more than just potential future threats; there must be an actual controversy or a genuine threat of enforcement.
   
   - **Option C**: This option claims that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on the arrest of his companions and prior warnings. Given the Supreme Court's criteria, this seems to align with the requirement for a genuine threat of enforcement, making it a strong candidate.
   
   - **Option D**: This option suggests that the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student’s fears are speculative. While the fear might seem speculative at first glance, the arrest of his companions and prior warnings provide a basis to argue that there is a genuine threat.

4. **Conclusion Based on Supreme Court Precedent**:
   - The key factor here is whether the law student can demonstrate a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on the actions taken by the police towards his friends.
   - Given the arrest and prior warnings, it can be argued that there is a sufficient basis to show a genuine threat of enforcement.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option aligns with the Supreme Court's criteria for declaratory judgment actions, which require an actual controversy or a genuine threat of enforcement.",1.0,"Analyze the problem statement meticulously, apply necessary theories or calculations, eliminate incorrect options based on given information, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",9
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM will give us the minimum number of days after which all three planets will be in their initial positions relative to each other again.

The given orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Identify the Highest Powers of Each Prime**:
   - For \(2\): The highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\): The highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\): The highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

3. **Calculate the LCM**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2
   \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     - \(2^3 = 8\)
     - \(3^3 = 27\)
     - \(5^2 = 25\)

4. **Multiply the Results**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 8 \times 27 \times 25
   \]
   - First, multiply 8 and 27:
     \[
     8 \times 27 = 216
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by 25:
     \[
     216 \times 25 = 5400
     \]

Thus, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.

The correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,"Analyze the problem statement meticulously, apply necessary theories or calculations, eliminate incorrect options based on given information, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",9
