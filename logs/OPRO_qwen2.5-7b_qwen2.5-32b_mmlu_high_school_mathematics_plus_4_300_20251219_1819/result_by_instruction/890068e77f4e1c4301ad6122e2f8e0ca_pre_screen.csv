"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done to charge the capacitor),
- \( C \) is the capacitance of the capacitor,
- \( V \) is the potential difference across the capacitor.

Given in the problem:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Now we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

First, calculate \( (100 V)^2 \):

\[ (100 V)^2 = 10000 V^2 \]

Now substitute this back into the equation:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 50 \times 10^{-3} J \]
\[ U = 0.05 J \]

Therefore, the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V is \( 0.05 J \).

The correct answer is (C) 0.05 J.",1.0,"Analyze the question in depth, apply appropriate theories or calculations, eliminate options that do not align with the provided information, and select the most accurate answer.",9
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To analyze this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedent. The key points to examine include:

1. **Nature of Declaratory Judgment**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that determines the rights and obligations between parties without ordering any specific action or awarding damages.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent on Declaratory Judgments**: In cases like *Warth v. Seldin* (1975), the Supreme Court established criteria for when declaratory judgments can be granted, including a ""real and immediate"" threat of enforcement against the plaintiff.

3. **Equity and Comity**: Courts generally avoid issuing declarations that might interfere with ongoing state prosecutions or administrative proceedings to maintain comity between federal and state courts.

4. **Threat of Enforcement**: The Supreme Court has held in cases such as *Leser v. Garnett* (1920) that a declaratory judgment can be granted if the plaintiff shows a ""real and immediate"" threat of enforcement against them, even if they are not currently facing prosecution.

Now let's analyze each option:

(A) **Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**
- This option suggests that the federal court should dismiss the action because it might interfere with ongoing state proceedings. However, this reasoning is not supported by Supreme Court precedent which allows for declaratory judgments in cases where there is a real threat of enforcement.

(B) **No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.**
- This option is incorrect as it does not consider the ""real and immediate"" threat requirement established by Supreme Court precedent.

(C) **No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**
- This option aligns with the criteria set forth in *Warth v. Seldin* where a ""real and immediate"" threat is required for declaratory relief. The arrest of the companions and prior warnings provide evidence that such a threat exists.

(D) **Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.**
- This option incorrectly dismisses the ""real and immediate"" threat established by Supreme Court precedent. The fact that the companions were arrested and warnings given indicate a real and imminent threat.

Given this analysis, the most accurate answer is:

(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.

This option correctly applies Supreme Court precedent regarding declaratory judgments and acknowledges the ""real and immediate"" threat that justifies the action.",0.0,"Analyze the question in depth, apply appropriate theories or calculations, eliminate options that do not align with the provided information, and select the most accurate answer.",9
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's break down the scenario and apply relevant principles from electrostatics.

1. **Initial Setup**: We have a nonconducting sphere with a net electric charge +Q and a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius.

2. **Induced Charges in Conductors**:
   - When a charged object (in this case, the nonconducting sphere) is brought close to a conductor, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. The side of the conductor closest to the charge will develop an induced negative charge, and the far side will develop an induced positive charge.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - (A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
     - This is not accurate because in a conductor, charges can only move on the surface; there are no free charges inside the conductor to create an internal electric field.
   
   - (B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
     - This is incorrect. While the side closest to the nonconducting sphere will have an induced negative charge, this does not mean the entire sphere will acquire a net charge of –Q. Instead, it will be partially charged with opposite signs on different parts of its surface.

   - (C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
     - This is correct because the nonconducting sphere has a positive charge +Q, and the induced negative charge on the side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere will create an attractive force between them. According to Coulomb's law, opposite charges attract.

   - (D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.
     - This is incorrect because there are no like charges that would cause repulsion in this scenario; instead, we have a positive charge attracting a negative charge.

4. **Conclusion**:
The most accurate answer based on the principles of electrostatics and induced charges in conductors is (C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",0.0,"Analyze the question in depth, apply appropriate theories or calculations, eliminate options that do not align with the provided information, and select the most accurate answer.",9
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, we factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

So, the inequality becomes:

\[ (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \]

To solve this inequality, we find the roots of the equation \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the inequality \( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \) holds for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Next, we need to ensure that the denominator is not zero. The expression under the square root must be strictly greater than zero, so there are no additional restrictions from this part.

Therefore, combining these results, the domain of \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers without a remainder.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Identify the Highest Powers of Each Prime**:
   - For \(2\): The highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\): The highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\): The highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

3. **Calculate the LCM**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2
   \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     - \(2^3 = 8\)
     - \(3^3 = 27\)
     - \(5^2 = 25\)

4. **Multiply the Results**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 8 \times 27 \times 25
   \]
   - First, multiply 8 and 27:
     \[
     8 \times 27 = 216
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by 25:
     \[
     216 \times 25 = 5400
     \]

Thus, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.
