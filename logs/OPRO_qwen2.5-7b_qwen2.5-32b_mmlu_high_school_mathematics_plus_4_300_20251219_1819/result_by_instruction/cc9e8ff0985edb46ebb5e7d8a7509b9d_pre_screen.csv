"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that the expression under the square root is positive and that the denominator is not zero. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Identify where the denominator is defined:**
   The denominator of \( f(x) \) is \( \sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 4} \). For the expression under the square root to be valid, it must be greater than zero (since a square root cannot be in the denominator if it's zero or negative).

2. **Solve the inequality:**
   We need to solve \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).
   
   First, factorize the quadratic expression:
   \[
   x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1)
   \]
   
   Next, determine where this product is positive. The roots of the equation \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \) are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

3. **Test each interval to determine where the expression is positive:**
   - For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \):
     Choose a test point, say \( x = -2 \).
     \[
     (x - 4)(x + 1) = (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0
     \]
   - For \( x \in (-1, 4) \):
     Choose a test point, say \( x = 0 \).
     \[
     (x - 4)(x + 1) = (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0
     \]
   - For \( x \in (4, \infty) \):
     Choose a test point, say \( x = 5 \).
     \[
     (x - 4)(x + 1) = (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0
     \]

   Therefore, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

4. **Combine with the requirement that the denominator is not zero:**
   The function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is defined for all \( x \) in the intervals where the expression under the square root is positive, which we have determined to be \( (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Thus, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:
\[
(-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty)
\]

Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedent. The key points to analyze include:

1. **Nature of Declaratory Judgment**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that determines the rights and obligations of parties without ordering any specific action or awarding damages.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent**: The most relevant case here is likely *O'Shea v. Littleton* (414 U.S. 488, 1974), where the Supreme Court established that a declaratory judgment should not be granted if it would interfere with ongoing state prosecutions or would otherwise disrupt the normal course of judicial proceedings.

3. **Threat of Enforcement**: The law student's companions were arrested for criminal trespass and loitering, which suggests there is an existing threat of enforcement against them under these statutes. However, this does not necessarily mean that the same threat exists for the law student himself, as his actions may be different or he might have a valid defense.

4. **Speculative Nature**: The Supreme Court has also held in cases like *Warth v. Seldin* (422 U.S. 490, 1975) that declaratory relief is not appropriate if the plaintiff's fears of enforcement are speculative or hypothetical.

Given these points:

- **Option A** suggests that the court would dismiss because it interferes with existing state prosecutions. This could be a valid reason but needs to be carefully considered in light of the law student’s own potential exposure.
  
- **Option B** states that a federal plaintiff may seek declaratory judgment even if not threatened by a state prosecution, which is generally true but does not address the specific circumstances here.

- **Option C** argues for non-dismissal based on the threat to his companions and prior warnings. This could be compelling as it shows a genuine threat of enforcement against him, aligning with *O'Shea v. Littleton*.

- **Option D** suggests dismissal due to speculative fears, which is less likely given the concrete actions and threats described.

Considering these points, the most accurate answer based on Supreme Court precedent would be:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option acknowledges both the potential for enforcement (as shown by the arrests) and the specific circumstances that might justify a declaratory judgment action in federal court.",1.0,"Analyze the question carefully, eliminate irrelevant options, apply necessary concepts or calculations, and choose the most accurate answer based on the provided information.",4
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's consider the principles involved:

1. **Induced Electric Field in Conductors**: When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, the charges within the conducting sphere will rearrange themselves due to the influence of the external electric field created by the nonconducting sphere.

2. **Charge Redistribution in Conductors**: In a conductor, free electrons can move freely and will be influenced by an external electric field. The presence of the positively charged nonconducting sphere will cause these free electrons to move towards the side of the conducting sphere that is closer to the nonconducting sphere. This movement results in a net negative charge on the side of the conducting sphere facing the nonconducting sphere and a corresponding positive charge on the opposite side.

3. **Electrostatic Forces**: The electrostatic force between two charges depends on their magnitudes and signs, as well as the distance between them. A positively charged object will attract negatively charged objects and repel other positively charged objects.

Given these principles:

- (A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere: This is true because the presence of a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q will induce an electric field in the conducting sphere, causing charges to rearrange.
  
- (B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q: This is not necessarily true. While there will be a redistribution of charges within the conducting sphere, it does not mean that the entire sphere will have a net negative charge of -Q. Instead, only one side of the conducting sphere will have an excess of electrons (negative charge), and the other side will have a deficiency of electrons (positive charge).

- (C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction: This is true because the positively charged nonconducting sphere will attract the negative charges on the side of the conducting sphere that faces it, leading to an attractive force between the two spheres.

- (D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion: This is not correct based on the principles described. There would be no net repulsive force since one sphere has a positive charge and the other has a negative charge on its facing side but overall remains neutral in terms of net charge.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided information is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",0.0,"Analyze the question carefully, eliminate irrelevant options, apply necessary concepts or calculations, and choose the most accurate answer based on the provided information.",4
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (work required),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\( C \)) = 10 µF = \( 10 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F} \)
- Potential difference (\( V \)) = 100 V

Now we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F}) \times (100 \, \text{V})^2 \]

First, calculate \( V^2 \):

\[ V^2 = (100)^2 = 10000 \, \text{V}^2 \]

Now substitute this back into the equation:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{J} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{J} \]
\[ U = 0.005 \, \text{J} \]

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:
