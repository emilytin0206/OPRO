"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the given scenario.

1. **Nonconducting Sphere with +Q Charge**: This sphere has a net positive charge of +Q. When brought close to another object (in this case, a neutral conducting sphere), it will induce charges on the surface of the conducting sphere due to the electric field created by the nonconducting sphere.

2. **Neutral Conducting Sphere**: A conductor distributes its charge such that the electric field inside is zero. This means any external electric field will cause the free electrons in the conductor to move and rearrange themselves until the internal electric field cancels out the external one.

3. **Induced Charges on the Conducting Sphere**:
   - When a positive charge (+Q) approaches, it repels the free electrons in the conducting sphere towards the side away from the nonconducting sphere.
   - This leaves an excess of positive charges (protons or ionized atoms) on the side closer to the nonconducting sphere.

4. **Electrostatic Forces**:
   - The induced positive charge on one side of the conducting sphere will attract the +Q charge, leading to a net electrostatic attraction between the two spheres.
   - There is no repulsion because the charges are distributed in such a way that the overall electric field inside both conductors is zero.

Now let's evaluate each option:

(A) **An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
- This statement is true, but it does not fully describe what happens next or the resulting forces between the spheres.

(B) **The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
- This is incorrect because the total charge on the conducting sphere remains zero (neutral). The charges are redistributed but do not add up to -Q.

(C) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
- This statement accurately describes the interaction between the two spheres due to the induced positive charge on one side of the conducting sphere and the +Q charge from the nonconducting sphere.

(D) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
- This is incorrect because there is no net repulsive force; instead, there is a net attractive force as described above.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the most precise answer is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement thoroughly, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer based on the provided information.",15
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 0.005 J.",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement thoroughly, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer based on the provided information.",15
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, determine where this product is greater than zero. The roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \) are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero and we have already ensured that it is positive in these intervals, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To analyze this problem statement thoroughly, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedent and the specific circumstances presented.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that clarifies or declares one's rights under existing laws without ordering any action. The primary purpose is to provide clarity on the legality of certain conduct before it results in actual harm.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent and Equitable Considerations**:
   - In *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club* (1975), the Supreme Court held that a declaratory judgment action can be dismissed if it would interfere with ongoing state prosecutions, as this could disrupt the orderly administration of justice.
   - However, in *American Trucking Ass'ns, Inc. v. Scheiner* (1984), the Court allowed a declaratory judgment action where there was a genuine threat of enforcement against the plaintiff.

3. **Applying the Facts**:
   - The law student has already been warned by the police and his companions have been arrested for criminal trespass and loitering.
   - There is a clear and present danger that the law student could be subject to similar charges if he continues with his protest activities, as evidenced by the prior warnings and arrests of his friends.

4. **Analyzing Each Option**:
   - (A) This option suggests dismissing the action due to interference with state prosecutions. While this is a valid concern, it does not fully account for the law student's demonstrated threat.
   - (B) This option incorrectly states that a federal plaintiff may seek declaratory judgment regardless of any state prosecution threats, which contradicts *California Fish & Game Comm'n v. Sierra Club*.
   - (C) This option correctly identifies the presence of a genuine threat to the law student based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings, aligning with *American Trucking Ass'ns, Inc. v. Scheiner*.
   - (D) This option incorrectly dismisses the action as premature without considering the actual threat faced by the law student.

Based on this analysis, the most precise answer is:

**C: No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This conclusion aligns with Supreme Court precedent that allows declaratory judgment actions when there is a genuine threat of enforcement, even if no state prosecution has yet occurred.",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement thoroughly, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer based on the provided information.",15
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:
