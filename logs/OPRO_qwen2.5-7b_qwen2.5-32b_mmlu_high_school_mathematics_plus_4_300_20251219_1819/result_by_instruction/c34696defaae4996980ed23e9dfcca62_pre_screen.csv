"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (work required),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\( C \)) = 10 µF = \( 10 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F} \)
- Potential difference (\( V \)) = 100 V

Now we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F}) \times (100 \, \text{V})^2 \]

First, calculate \( V^2 \):

\[ V^2 = (100)^2 = 10000 \, \text{V}^2 \]

Next, substitute this value back into the equation:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.1 \]
\[ U = 0.05 \, \text{J} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To analyze this problem statement thoroughly, we need to consider the legal principles involved in seeking declaratory judgments, particularly as they relate to federal court jurisdiction and the potential for interfering with state prosecutions.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a lawsuit filed by someone who wants a court to declare their rights or obligations under a specific set of circumstances. The purpose is to clarify legal relationships without necessarily seeking an injunction or other form of relief.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent and Federalism**: The Supreme Court has established that federal courts should be cautious about issuing declaratory judgments that might interfere with state prosecutions, as this could undermine the sovereignty of state governments and potentially disrupt ongoing criminal proceedings. This principle is rooted in equity and comity between states and the federal government.

3. **Analysis of Each Option**:
   - **Option (A)**: This option suggests that the declaratory relief would be dismissed because it interferes with existing state prosecutions, which aligns with the Supreme Court's caution against such actions.
   - **Option (B)**: This is incorrect as it contradicts the principle that a federal plaintiff cannot seek declaratory judgment if they are not threatened by a state prosecution on the same statute.
   - **Option (C)**: While the arrest of his companions and prior warnings might indicate a genuine threat, this does not necessarily justify issuing a declaratory judgment. The Supreme Court has been cautious about such actions even when there is a perceived threat.
   - **Option (D)**: This option suggests that the relief would be premature because the law student's fears are speculative. However, the existence of prior warnings and arrests could provide some basis for a claim of imminent enforcement.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the Supreme Court's caution against issuing declaratory judgments that might interfere with state prosecutions or disrupt ongoing criminal proceedings, the most accurate answer is:

**(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**

This option correctly reflects the legal principles governing federal court jurisdiction in such matters.",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement thoroughly, apply relevant concepts or calculations, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most accurate answer based on the given information.",3
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's break down each option and apply relevant concepts from electrostatics.

### Given Information:
- A nonconducting sphere with a net electric charge \( +Q \).
- A neutral conducting sphere of the same radius as the nonconducting sphere.
- The nonconducting sphere is brought close to the conducting sphere.

### Analysis:

1. **Option (A): An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
   - When a charged object approaches a conductor, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. Specifically, the side of the conductor closest to the charge will develop an opposite charge, and the far side will develop a similar charge.
   - This is due to the redistribution of free electrons in the conductor under the influence of the external electric field created by the nonconducting sphere.

2. **Option (B): The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
   - A neutral conducting sphere cannot have a net charge because, by definition, it has an equal number of positive and negative charges.
   - However, there can be induced charges on its surface due to the external field but not a net charge.

3. **Option (C): The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
   - A nonconducting sphere with \( +Q \) will create an electric field around it.
   - This electric field will induce opposite charges on the side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere, and similar charges on the far side.
   - The induced negative charge on the near side of the conducting sphere will attract the positive charge of the nonconducting sphere.

4. **Option (D): The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
   - This is incorrect because the induced charges on the conducting sphere will result in a net attractive force between the two spheres, not repulsive.

### Conclusion:
- Option (A) is correct as it describes the induction of charges within the conducting sphere.
- Option (C) correctly identifies that there will be an electrostatic attraction due to the induced charges.

However, since we need to select the most accurate answer based on the given options and the core question about what will be true:

The most accurate single statement is:
**Option (A): An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**

This directly addresses the immediate effect of bringing a charged nonconducting sphere close to a neutral conducting sphere, which is the induction of charges in the conductor.

Therefore, the correct answer is **(A)**.",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement thoroughly, apply relevant concepts or calculations, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most accurate answer based on the given information.",3
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, determine where this product is greater than zero. The roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \) are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero and we have already ensured that it is positive in these intervals, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:
