"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a capacitor, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

Calculate step by step:
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-2} J \]
\[ U = 0.05 J \]

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the scenario described.

1. **Induced Electric Field (Option A):**
   - When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere. This is because the presence of the charged sphere will cause charges in the conducting sphere to rearrange themselves due to electrostatic forces.

2. **Net Electric Charge on the Conducting Sphere (Option B):**
   - A neutral conducting sphere does not have a net charge, and when brought close to another charged object, it will redistribute its charges but will not acquire a net charge of –Q or +Q. Instead, it will develop induced charges that will balance out any external influence.

3. **Electrostatic Forces (Options C & D):**
   - The key here is understanding the nature of the force between the two spheres. Since one sphere has a positive charge and the other is neutral but becomes polarized due to induction, there will be an attractive electrostatic force between them because opposite charges attract.

Given these points:

- Option A is correct in that an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere.
- Option B is incorrect as the conducting sphere does not acquire a net charge of –Q or +Q; it redistributes its charges to balance the influence.
- Options C and D are related but need clarification: there will be an electrostatic attraction, so both could be considered correct in different contexts. However, since we're asked for the most precise answer based on the principles involved, option C is more directly relevant.

Therefore, the best choice from the given options is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.

This accurately describes the interaction between a positively charged nonconducting sphere and a neutral conducting sphere due to induced charges in the conductor.",1.0,"Analyze the given information thoroughly, apply relevant concepts or calculations as needed, and select the most precise answer from the options provided.",3
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"The correct answer is (C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.

Explanation:

This question involves understanding the principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions in federal court, particularly under the Declaratory Judgment Act. The key points to consider are:

1. **Genuine Threat of Enforcement**: For a declaratory judgment action to be granted, there must be a genuine threat or likelihood that the plaintiff will face enforcement of the statute in question. In this case, the arrest of his companions and prior warnings from the police provide evidence of such a threat.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent**: The Supreme Court has established criteria for granting declaratory judgments, emphasizing the need to avoid unnecessary interference with ongoing state proceedings (equity and comity) but also recognizing that a plaintiff can seek relief if they are genuinely threatened by enforcement actions.

3. **Prematurity of the Action**: While it is true that the law student's fears might be speculative in terms of immediate arrest, the Supreme Court has allowed declaratory judgments where there is a clear and present danger or threat of enforcement. The prior warnings and arrests provide sufficient grounds to support the claim of a genuine threat.

4. **Equity and Comity**: While equity and comity are important considerations, they do not necessarily preclude granting relief if the plaintiff can demonstrate a genuine threat of enforcement. The Supreme Court has recognized that declaratory judgments can be granted even in cases where there is no immediate danger but a clear and present threat exists.

Therefore, based on these principles and the specific facts provided, the federal district court would likely deny dismissal of the declaratory judgment action because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him.",1.0,"Analyze the given information thoroughly, apply relevant concepts or calculations as needed, and select the most precise answer from the options provided.",3
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers, and the denominator cannot be zero.
2. We need to solve the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, let's factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, we find the roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We need to test each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
- For \( x < -1 \): Choose a test point, say \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose a test point, say \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose a test point, say \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x < -1 \) and \( x > 4 \). Therefore, the domain of the function \( f(x) \) is:
\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

\[ 2^3 = 8 \]
\[ 3^3 = 27 \]
\[ 5^2 = 25 \]

Multiplying these together:
\[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
\[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.

The correct answer is:
(B) 5400",1.0,"Analyze the given information thoroughly, apply relevant concepts or calculations as needed, and select the most precise answer from the options provided.",3
