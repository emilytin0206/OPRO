"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved:

1. **Induced Electric Field in Conductors**: When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, the charges within the conducting sphere will rearrange themselves due to the influence of the external electric field created by the nonconducting sphere.

2. **Charge Redistribution in Conductors**: In a conductor, free electrons are not fixed and can move freely throughout the material. When an external electric field is applied (in this case, from the nonconducting sphere), these free electrons will be displaced to one side of the conducting sphere, creating an induced charge distribution.

3. **Charge Induction**: The side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere with +Q will develop a negative charge due to the repulsion of the free electrons by the positive charge from the nonconducting sphere. Conversely, the far side of the conducting sphere will have a net positive charge as it accumulates fewer electrons.

4. **Electrostatic Forces**: The induced charges on both spheres will result in an electrostatic force between them. Since one sphere has a net positive charge and the other has an induced negative charge (on its near side), there will be an attractive force between the two spheres due to opposite charges attracting each other.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

- **(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere**: This is true because the external electric field from the nonconducting sphere causes a rearrangement of charges in the conducting sphere.
  
- **(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q**: This is incorrect. While there will be an induced negative charge on one side, the overall charge of the conducting sphere remains zero because free electrons can move to balance out any excess positive or negative charge.

- **(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction**: This is correct based on the principle that opposite charges attract each other.

- **(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion**: This is incorrect. Since one sphere has a net positive charge and the induced side of the conducting sphere has a negative charge, they will attract each other rather than repel.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the principles described is:

**(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**",0.0,"Analyze the given context or question thoroughly, apply relevant principles or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on provided information, and select the most accurate answer from those available.",7
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider principles from constitutional law, specifically related to declaratory judgment actions and the balance between federal and state interests.

The key Supreme Court precedent here is **Minneci v. Pollard** (2013), which deals with the circumstances under which a federal court can grant declaratory relief that might interfere with ongoing or anticipated state criminal proceedings. The principle of equity and comity, as mentioned in option A, plays a significant role.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) **Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**
- This option aligns well with the principles established by Minneci v. Pollard. The Supreme Court has held that a federal court should not issue a declaratory judgment that might interfere with ongoing or anticipated state criminal proceedings, as it could disrupt the balance between federal and state interests.

(B) **No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.**
- This option does not consider the specific circumstances of equity and comity that are relevant in this case. The law student's companions were arrested, which creates a genuine threat to him as well.

(C) **No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**
- While this option acknowledges the existence of a genuine threat, it does not address the principle that declaratory relief should be avoided if it might interfere with ongoing or anticipated state criminal proceedings.

(D) **Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.**
- This option suggests that the action is premature due to speculation about future events. However, the Supreme Court has recognized that a genuine threat can justify seeking declaratory relief even if it involves some degree of speculation.

Given these considerations, the most accurate answer based on the principles established by Minneci v. Pollard and the balance between federal and state interests is:

**A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**

This option correctly identifies that the potential interference with ongoing or anticipated state criminal proceedings justifies dismissing the declaratory judgment action in this case.",0.0,"Analyze the given context or question thoroughly, apply relevant principles or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on provided information, and select the most accurate answer from those available.",7
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

First, let's solve for when the expression under the square root is greater than zero:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

We start by finding the roots of the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \]

So, the roots are:

\[ x = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -1 \]

Next, we analyze the sign of \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \) in the intervals determined by these roots: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

- For \( x < -1 \): Choose a test point, say \( x = -2 \):
  \[ (-2)^2 - 3(-2) - 4 = 4 + 6 - 4 = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose a test point, say \( x = 0 \):
  \[ (0)^2 - 3(0) - 4 = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x > 4 \): Choose a test point, say \( x = 5 \):
  \[ (5)^2 - 3(5) - 4 = 25 - 15 - 4 = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \) is positive in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero, we exclude the points where the expression equals zero, which are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \). Therefore, the domain of the function is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.
