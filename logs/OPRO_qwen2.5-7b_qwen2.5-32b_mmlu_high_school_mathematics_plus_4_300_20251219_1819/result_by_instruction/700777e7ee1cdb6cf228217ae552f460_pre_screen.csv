"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, determine where this product is greater than zero. The roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \) are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point from each interval to determine where the expression is positive:

- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]

- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero and we have already ensured that it is positive in these intervals, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To solve this problem, let's analyze each option based on the principles of electrostatics and the behavior of conductors in the presence of charges.

1. **Option (A): An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
   - When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, an electric field is indeed induced within the conducting sphere due to the influence of the external charge. This induced electric field causes charges in the conductor to rearrange themselves.

2. **Option (B): The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
   - A conducting sphere cannot have a net charge different from that which is induced by an external charge, because any excess charge on a conductor distributes itself such that the net charge remains zero in the bulk of the conductor. However, charges can be rearranged on its surface.

3. **Option (C): The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
   - A positive charge (+Q) near a neutral conducting sphere will induce negative charges on the side of the conducting sphere closest to the +Q and positive charges on the opposite side. This induced charge distribution results in an attractive force between the two spheres due to the opposite charges attracting each other.

4. **Option (D): The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
   - Since one sphere is positively charged (+Q) and the other has a net induced negative charge on its surface, there should be an attractive force rather than a repulsive one between them.

Based on these analyses:

- Option (A) is correct because an electric field is indeed induced within the conducting sphere.
- Option (B) is incorrect as the conducting sphere will not develop a net charge of –Q; it will have charges rearranged but no overall net charge change from being neutral initially.
- Option (C) is correct regarding the electrostatic attraction between the spheres due to the induced charges.
- Option (D) is incorrect because there should be an attractive force, not repulsion.

Given that both options (A) and (C) are true based on the principles of electrostatics, but we need to select the most accurate answer from those given:

The correct answer is **(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**",1.0,"Analyze the problem carefully, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on provided information, and select the most accurate answer from those given.",16
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider relevant legal principles, particularly those related to declaratory judgment actions and the standards for obtaining such relief. The key Supreme Court precedent here is likely derived from the Declaratory Judgment Act (D.J.A.) of 1934, which was designed to provide a means for individuals to seek clarification on their rights without having to wait until they are actually threatened with prosecution.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
- This option suggests that the federal court should dismiss the action because it might interfere with ongoing state proceedings. However, this reasoning is not typically applied in cases where there is no actual or imminent threat to the plaintiff.

(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
- This option incorrectly states that the law student can file for declaratory relief without any threat of enforcement. The Supreme Court has generally required some level of actual or imminent threat to justify such an action.

(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
- This option correctly identifies that the law student's situation involves a credible threat of enforcement. The Supreme Court has allowed declaratory judgments in cases where there is a real and immediate danger of prosecution.

(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.
- This option suggests that the action should be dismissed due to the speculative nature of the law student’s fears. However, the Supreme Court has recognized that declaratory judgments can be granted even if there is no immediate threat but where there is a genuine and imminent danger.

Given these considerations, the most accurate answer is:

(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.

This option correctly applies the legal standards for obtaining declaratory relief, recognizing that the law student's situation involves a credible threat of prosecution.",0.0,"Analyze the problem carefully, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on provided information, and select the most accurate answer from those given.",16
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done to charge the capacitor),
- \( C \) is the capacitance of the capacitor,
- \( V \) is the potential difference across the capacitor.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

First, calculate \( (100 V)^2 \):

\[ (100 V)^2 = 10000 V^2 \]

Now substitute this back into the equation:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times 10000 V^2 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 \times 10^{-3} J \]
\[ U = 50 \times 10^{-3} J \]
\[ U = 0.05 J \]

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM will give us the minimum number of days after which all three planets will be in their initial positions relative to each other again.

The given orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

\[ 2^3 = 8 \]
\[ 3^3 = 27 \]
\[ 5^2 = 25 \]

Multiplying these together:
\[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
\[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.
