"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's break down the scenario and apply relevant principles from electrostatics.

### Scenario Analysis:
- A nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge \(+Q\) is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Induced Charges in Conductors**: When a charged object (in this case, the nonconducting sphere) approaches a conductor, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. The side of the conductor closest to the charge will develop an induced negative charge, and the far side will develop an induced positive charge.
2. **Electrostatic Forces**: Opposite charges attract each other, while like charges repel.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Induced Charges**:
   - The nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge \(+Q\) will induce negative charges on the side of the conducting sphere closest to it and positive charges on the opposite side.
   - This is because the electric field from the nonconducting sphere will push electrons towards the surface of the conductor, creating an induced negative charge.

2. **Net Charge on Conducting Sphere**:
   - The conducting sphere initially has no net charge (\(0\)).
   - After induction, it will have a net negative charge due to the redistribution of charges.
   - However, the total charge must still be zero because the conductor is electrically neutral overall.

3. **Electrostatic Forces**:
   - The induced negative charge on the side closest to the nonconducting sphere and the positive charge on the opposite side will create an attractive force between the two spheres due to the attraction between opposite charges.
   
### Evaluating the Options:

- **(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
  - This is not accurate because the electric field inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is zero.

- **(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
  - This is incorrect because the total charge on the conducting sphere must remain zero due to its initial state as neutral and the fact that charges can only be redistributed, not created or destroyed.

- **(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
  - This is correct based on the induced charges described above.

- **(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
  - This is incorrect because the closest side of the conducting sphere has a negative charge, which attracts the positive charge from the nonconducting sphere.

### Conclusion:
The most accurate answer is (C): The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",1.0,"Analyze the question in depth, use relevant theories or calculations as necessary, eliminate wrong options logically, and select the most accurate answer based on the provided information.",18
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

### Step 1: Factorize the quadratic expression
First, we factorize the quadratic equation:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

### Step 2: Determine where the expression is positive
We need to find the intervals where \( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \). The roots of the equation are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \).

These roots divide the real number line into three intervals:
- \( (-\infty, -1) \)
- \( (-1, 4) \)
- \( (4, \infty) \)

We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:

- For \( x < -1 \), choose \( x = -2 \):
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]

- For \( -1 < x < 4 \), choose \( x = 0 \):
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x > 4 \), choose \( x = 5 \):
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the expression \( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \) is true in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 3: Combine with the condition that the denominator cannot be zero
The function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{(x-4)(x+1)}} \) is undefined when the denominator is zero. The roots of the quadratic equation are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \), so these points must be excluded from the domain.

### Conclusion
The domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:
\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider relevant legal principles, particularly those established by the U.S. Supreme Court regarding declaratory judgment actions and their relationship with state prosecutions.

### Analysis:

1. **Declaratory Judgment Act (DJA) - 28 U.S.C. § 2201:**
   The DJA allows a person ""affected or aggrieved"" by a statute, regulation, or other governmental action to seek a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations. However, the Supreme Court has set certain conditions for when such actions can be brought.

2. **Supreme Court Precedents:**
   - **Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores (1978):** The Court held that declaratory relief is not available where it would interfere with pending or impending state prosecutions.
   - **Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman (1982):** The Court emphasized the need for a ""genuine threat of enforcement"" to justify seeking declaratory judgment.

3. **Applying the Precedents:**
   - **Option A:** This option suggests that the federal district court would dismiss the action because it interferes with existing state prosecutions and would be disallowed due to equity and comity considerations. While this is a valid concern, it does not fully address the student's situation.
   - **Option B:** This option states that a federal plaintiff may seek declaratory judgment even if they are not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute. However, the Supreme Court has been cautious about issuing such relief when there is no immediate threat of enforcement.
   - **Option C:** This option argues that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on the arrest of his companions and prior warnings. This aligns with the requirement set by Pennhurst State School & Hospital, as it demonstrates a concrete risk of future prosecution.
   - **Option D:** This option suggests that declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears are speculative. While this is true in some cases, the Supreme Court has recognized situations where a genuine threat exists.

### Conclusion:

Given the facts and the relevant legal principles, the most accurate answer is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly identifies that the law student has demonstrated a concrete risk of future prosecution, which meets the Supreme Court's requirement for seeking declaratory judgment in such circumstances.",1.0,"Analyze the question in depth, use relevant theories or calculations as necessary, eliminate wrong options logically, and select the most accurate answer based on the provided information.",18
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

First, calculate \( V^2 \):

\[ V^2 = (100 V)^2 = 10000 V^2 \]

Now substitute this back into the equation:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} J \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 J \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 0.005 J.",0.0,"Analyze the question in depth, use relevant theories or calculations as necessary, eliminate wrong options logically, and select the most accurate answer based on the provided information.",18
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers without a remainder.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Identify the Highest Powers of Each Prime**:
   - For \(2\): The highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\): The highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\): The highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

3. **Calculate the LCM**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2
   \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     - \(2^3 = 8\)
     - \(3^3 = 27\)
     - \(5^2 = 25\)

4. **Multiply the Results**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 8 \times 27 \times 25
   \]
   - First, multiply 8 and 27:
     \[
     8 \times 27 = 216
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by 25:
     \[
     216 \times 25 = 5400
     \]

Thus, the least common multiple of 360, 450, and 540 is 5400.

### Conclusion:

The minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \( \boxed{5400} \).",0.0,"Analyze the question in depth, use relevant theories or calculations as necessary, eliminate wrong options logically, and select the most accurate answer based on the provided information.",18
