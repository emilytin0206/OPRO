"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers, and the denominator cannot be zero.
2. We need to solve the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, let's factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, we find the roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We need to test each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
- For \( x < -1 \): Choose a test point, say \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose a test point, say \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose a test point, say \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x < -1 \) and \( x > 4 \). Therefore, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:
\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

So, the correct answer is:

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"The correct answer is (C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.

Explanation:
- **Option A** is incorrect because while there might be concerns about interfering with state prosecutions, the Supreme Court has recognized that declaratory judgments can be sought to prevent imminent threats of prosecution.
- **Option B** is incorrect because it does not consider the specific circumstances where a plaintiff can seek declaratory relief even if they are not directly threatened by a current prosecution. The law student's companions' arrest and prior warnings indicate an ongoing threat.
- **Option C** correctly identifies that the law student has shown a genuine threat of enforcement, which is sufficient to justify seeking declaratory relief under Supreme Court precedent.
- **Option D** incorrectly dismisses the possibility of a genuine threat based on speculative fears. The evidence provided (arrests and warnings) indicates an actual risk.

Therefore, given the context and Supreme Court precedents regarding declaratory judgments, the federal district court would likely not dismiss the action as the law student has demonstrated a legitimate and imminent threat to his own freedom of speech rights.",1.0,Analyze each option carefully in relation to the given problem context and select the most accurate answer based on the provided information.,2
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved:

1. **Induced Electric Field in Conductors**: When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, the electric field from the nonconducting sphere will induce charges on the surface of the conducting sphere.

2. **Charge Induction and Distribution**: In a conductor, free electrons can move freely under the influence of an external electric field. The presence of the charged nonconducting sphere will cause these free electrons to redistribute themselves on the surface of the conducting sphere in such a way that they create an induced electric field that opposes the external field from the nonconducting sphere.

3. **Charge Distribution**: As a result, one side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere will develop a negative charge (induced by the positive charge), and the opposite side will develop a positive charge. This is due to the movement of electrons away from the region near the nonconducting sphere.

4. **Electrostatic Forces**: The induced charges on the conducting sphere will create an electrostatic force that attracts the nonconducting sphere (since they have opposite charges).

Given these points, let's evaluate each option:

(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
- This is true because the free electrons in the conductor will move to induce a charge distribution.

(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
- This is not necessarily true. The conducting sphere will have an induced charge, but it won't have a net charge of -Q; instead, there will be a separation of charges on its surface.

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
- This is correct because the positive charge on the nonconducting sphere and the negative charge on one side of the conducting sphere will attract each other.

(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.
- This is incorrect because, as explained above, there will be an attractive force between the two spheres due to their opposite charges.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided information is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",0.0,Analyze each option carefully in relation to the given problem context and select the most accurate answer based on the provided information.,2
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ E = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( E \) is the energy (work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ E = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

Calculate step by step:
\[ E = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]
\[ E = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]
\[ E = 5 \times 10^{-2} J \]

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To determine the minimum positive number of days after which planets X, Y, and Z will be aligned again in their initial positions relative to each other and the sun, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their orbital periods. The orbital periods are 360 days for planet X, 450 days for planet Y, and 540 days for planet Z.

First, let's factorize each number into its prime factors:
- \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
- \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
- \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in these factorizations:
- The highest power of 2 is \(2^3\).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^3\).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\).

Thus, the LCM is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 = 8 \times 27 \times 25 = 5400. \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.

The correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,Analyze each option carefully in relation to the given problem context and select the most accurate answer based on the provided information.,2
