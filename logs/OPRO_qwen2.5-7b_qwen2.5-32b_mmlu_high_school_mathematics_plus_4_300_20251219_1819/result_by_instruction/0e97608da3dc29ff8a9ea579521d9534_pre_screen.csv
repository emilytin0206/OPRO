"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Next, multiply the values:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 50 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 0.05 \, \text{J} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider principles from constitutional law, specifically related to declaratory judgment actions and the balance between federal and state interests.

### Analysis:

1. **Declaratory Judgment Act (DJA) - 28 U.S.C. § 2201**: This act allows a person ""to have determined any question of construction of an act of Congress, or validity of a statute or regulation under any act of Congress, or the constitutionality of the statutes or regulations.""

2. **Supreme Court Precedents**:
   - **Younger v. Harris (1971)**: This case established that federal courts should not issue injunctions to stop ongoing state criminal proceedings unless there is a showing of irreparable harm and a likelihood of success on the merits.
   - **Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman (1982)**: The Court extended Younger abstention to declaratory judgments, stating that federal courts should not issue declaratory relief if it would interfere with ongoing state proceedings.

3. **Applying the Principles**:
   - The law student is seeking a declaratory judgment on the constitutionality of criminal statutes.
   - His companions have already been arrested for violating these statutes, indicating an existing threat to his own freedom.
   - However, the question asks whether the federal district court will dismiss the action based on Younger abstention principles.

### Evaluating Each Option:

- **Option (A)**: This option correctly identifies that declaratory relief could interfere with ongoing state prosecutions. Given Younger v. Harris and Pennhurst, this is a strong argument for dismissal.
  
- **Option (B)**: This option incorrectly states that the law student can seek declaratory judgment regardless of any state prosecution threat. This is not accurate under Younger abstention principles.

- **Option (C)**: While it acknowledges a genuine threat to the law student, this does not address the core issue of whether the federal court should dismiss based on Younger v. Harris and Pennhurst.

- **Option (D)**: This option incorrectly states that the relief is premature because fears are speculative. The arrest of his companions provides a concrete basis for the claim, making it less about speculation than about the ongoing threat to his freedom.

### Conclusion:

The most accurate answer based on Supreme Court precedent is:

**(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**",0.0,"Analyze the question in detail, apply relevant principles or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most accurate answer from those provided based on the given information.",14
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, determine where this product is greater than zero. The roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \) are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero and we have already ensured that it is positive in these intervals, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's break down the scenario and apply relevant principles from electrostatics.

### Given:
- A nonconducting sphere with a net electric charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius.

### Analysis:

1. **Electric Field Induction in Conductors:**
   - When a charged object (in this case, the nonconducting sphere) approaches a conductor, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. The induced charges rearrange themselves such that they create an electric field that opposes the external field due to the nonconducting sphere.

2. **Charge Distribution in Conductors:**
   - In a conductor, free electrons are mobile and can move freely within the material. When a charged object is brought close, these free electrons will be displaced by the external electric field.
   - For a neutral conducting sphere, this means that some of its free electrons will be pushed to one side (opposite to the charge on the nonconducting sphere) while an equal number of positive charges from the nuclei will move to the other side.

3. **Induced Charges:**
   - The induced charges in the conductor will create their own electric field, which will partially cancel out the external field due to the nonconducting sphere.
   - As a result, the net charge on the conducting sphere remains zero because the positive and negative charges are equal but opposite.

4. **Electrostatic Forces:**
   - The induced charges on the conducting sphere will create an electric field that attracts the nonconducting sphere (since they have opposite signs).
   - Therefore, there will be an electrostatic attraction between the two spheres.

### Evaluating the Options:

- **(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
  - This is true because of the rearrangement of charges due to induction.
  
- **(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
  - This is incorrect because, in a conductor, free electrons can move and balance out any external field, resulting in no net charge on the conductor.

- **(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
  - This is true due to the induced charges creating an attractive force between them.
  
- **(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
  - This is incorrect because, as explained above, the charges on the conducting sphere are induced in such a way that they attract the nonconducting sphere.

### Conclusion:
The most accurate answer based on the given information and principles of electrostatics is:

**(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**",0.0,"Analyze the question in detail, apply relevant principles or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most accurate answer from those provided based on the given information.",14
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For the prime factor \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For the prime factor \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For the prime factor \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.
