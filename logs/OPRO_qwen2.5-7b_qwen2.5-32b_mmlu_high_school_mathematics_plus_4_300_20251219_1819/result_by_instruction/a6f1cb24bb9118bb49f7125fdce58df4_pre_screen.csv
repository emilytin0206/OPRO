"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the scenario described.

1. **Induced Electric Field (Option A):**
   - When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere. This is because the presence of the charged nonconducting sphere will cause charges in the conducting sphere to rearrange themselves due to electrostatic induction.

2. **Net Electric Charge on Conducting Sphere (Option B):**
   - The conducting sphere initially has no net charge, but when brought close to a positively charged object, it will not develop a net electric charge of –Q. Instead, charges within the conductor will rearrange such that an equal and opposite charge is induced on the side closest to the nonconducting sphere, while the other side will have an equal positive charge. This ensures that the overall charge distribution in the conductor remains balanced.

3. **Electrostatic Forces (Options C & D):**
   - The electrostatic force between two objects depends on their charges and the distance between them. Since one object has a net positive charge +Q, and the other is induced to have an equal but opposite charge –Q at its closest point due to induction, there will be an attractive force between these points of interaction.
   
   - However, it's important to note that the entire conducting sphere will not uniformly acquire a negative charge. The overall net charge on the conducting sphere remains zero because charges can move freely within the conductor but cannot accumulate in excess.

Given this analysis:

- **Option A** is correct as an electric field will be induced.
- **Option B** is incorrect since the conducting sphere does not develop a net charge of –Q; it develops localized charges due to induction.
- **Option C** is correct because there will indeed be an electrostatic attraction between the spheres, specifically at their closest points.

- **Option D** would only be true if both spheres had like charges (both positive or both negative), which is not the case here.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided information and principles of electrostatics is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",1.0,"Analyze the question thoroughly, apply relevant concepts or calculations as necessary, and select the most accurate answer based on the provided information.",8
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers, and the denominator cannot be zero.
2. We need to solve the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, let's factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, we find the roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We need to test each interval to determine where the expression is positive:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \):
  Choose a test point, say \( x = -2 \).
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \):
  Choose a test point, say \( x = 0 \).
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \):
  Choose a test point, say \( x = 5 \).
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

From the tests above, we see that \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

Therefore, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:
\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedent and the specific circumstances presented.

The key points from the scenario include:
- The law student and friends were peacefully handing out fliers at a mall.
- They received warnings from police but continued their activities.
- Their companions were arrested for criminal trespass and loitering.
- The law student filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes.

The Supreme Court has established that declaratory judgments can be granted when there is a ""real and immediate"" threat of enforcement against the plaintiff. This principle is derived from cases such as *Warth v. Seldin* (1975), where the Court outlined criteria for determining whether a case presents an actual controversy.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) **Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**
- This is incorrect because the law student has not been prosecuted under the statute in question; his companions were arrested, but he seeks a declaratory judgment to avoid future enforcement.

(B) **No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.**
- This statement is too broad and does not address the specific circumstances of the law student's case. The Supreme Court has required more than just potential future threats for a declaratory judgment to be granted.

(C) **No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**
- This is correct. The law student can demonstrate that he faces a real and immediate threat of prosecution based on the actions taken against his friends and the previous warnings from the police.

(D) **Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.**
- This is incorrect as the law student has concrete evidence (arrests of companions and prior warnings) that suggests he faces a real threat of enforcement under the statute in question.

Therefore, based on Supreme Court precedent and the specific circumstances provided, the most accurate answer is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**",0.0,"Analyze the question thoroughly, apply relevant concepts or calculations as necessary, and select the most accurate answer based on the provided information.",8
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the numbers without any remainder.

The given orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

To find the LCM, we can use their prime factorizations:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Finding the LCM**:
   The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in these factorizations.
   - For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Therefore, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Calculating this product step-by-step:
- First, calculate \(2^3\):
  \[ 2^3 = 8 \]
- Next, calculate \(3^3\):
  \[ 3^3 = 27 \]
- Then, calculate \(5^2\):
  \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

Now multiply these together:
\[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
\[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Thus, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
