"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

First, calculate \( V^2 \):

\[ V^2 = (100 V)^2 = 10000 V^2 \]

Now substitute this back into the equation:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} J \]
\[ U = 0.005 J \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 0.005 J",0.0,"Analyze the question in depth, apply relevant theories or calculations, eliminate incorrect options, and choose the most precise answer based on the provided information.",10
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider relevant legal principles, particularly those related to declaratory judgment actions and the standards for obtaining such relief. Let’s analyze each option in detail:

(A) **Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**
- This option suggests that a federal court should not grant declaratory relief because it might interfere with ongoing state proceedings. However, this is generally not a valid reason to dismiss a declaratory judgment action unless the interference is substantial and immediate.

(B) **No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.**
- This option is incorrect as it does not consider the specific circumstances of the case. The law student's companions were arrested, which indicates an existing threat to him based on similar conduct.

(C) **No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**
- This option is correct. The Supreme Court has recognized that a declaratory judgment action may be granted when there is a ""genuine threat"" or ""real danger of immediate and irreparable injury."" The fact that the law student's friends were arrested and he received warnings provides sufficient evidence to support his claim.

(D) **Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.**
- This option is incorrect as it dismisses the actual threat posed by the prior arrests and warnings. The Supreme Court has held that a plaintiff can seek declaratory judgment when there is a ""real danger"" or ""imminent threat,"" not just speculation.

Based on these analyses, the most precise answer is:

**C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly identifies that the law student has a legitimate basis to seek declaratory relief due to the existing threats posed by the state's actions.",0.0,"Analyze the question in depth, apply relevant theories or calculations, eliminate incorrect options, and choose the most precise answer based on the provided information.",10
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's break down the scenario and apply relevant principles from electrostatics.

1. **Initial Setup**: We have a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius.

2. **Induced Charges in Conductors**:
   - When a charged object is placed near a conductor, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. The side of the conductor closest to the charged object will develop an induced negative charge, and the far side will develop an induced positive charge.
   
3. **Electric Field within the Conductor**: In a conductor at electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside must be zero. This means that any external electric fields (due to the nonconducting sphere) are canceled out by the induced charges on the conducting sphere.

4. **Charge Distribution**:
   - The neutral conducting sphere will rearrange its free electrons in response to the nearby +Q charge.
   - The side of the conductor closest to the positive charge will have a net negative charge due to electron redistribution, and the far side will have a net positive charge.

5. **Electrostatic Forces Between Spheres**:
   - Since one sphere has a net positive charge (+Q) and the other has an induced net negative charge (–Q), there will be an electrostatic attraction between them.

Now let's evaluate each option:

(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
- This is true. The electric field from the nonconducting sphere induces charges on the surface of the conducting sphere, but the internal electric field remains zero due to the conductor’s properties.

(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
- This is not entirely accurate because while there will be an induced negative charge distribution, it does not mean the entire sphere will have a net charge of -Q. Instead, the charges are distributed on the surface in such a way that the internal field remains zero.

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
- This is true based on the principle of opposite charges attracting each other.

(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.
- This is incorrect because the induced negative charge on one sphere and positive charge on the nonconducting sphere result in an attractive force, not a repulsive one.

Given this analysis, the most precise answer is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",0.0,"Analyze the question in depth, apply relevant theories or calculations, eliminate incorrect options, and choose the most precise answer based on the provided information.",10
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the numerator and the denominator are defined. Specifically, for the square root in the denominator, the expression inside must be positive because the square root of a negative number is not real, and division by zero is undefined.

Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. **Identify where the denominator is defined:**
   The denominator is \(\sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 4}\). For the expression under the square root to be defined (and positive), we need:
   \[
   x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0
   \]

2. **Solve the inequality \(x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0\):**
   First, solve the equation \(x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0\) to find the critical points.
   \[
   x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) = 0
   \]
   So, the roots are:
   \[
   x = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -1
   \]

3. **Determine the intervals where \(x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0\):**
   The critical points divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -1)\), \((-1, 4)\), and \((4, \infty)\). We need to test each interval to see where the inequality holds.

   - For \(x \in (-\infty, -1)\):
     Choose a test point, say \(x = -2\).
     \[
     (-2)^2 - 3(-2) - 4 = 4 + 6 - 4 = 6 > 0
     \]
     So, the inequality holds in \((-\infty, -1)\).

   - For \(x \in (-1, 4)\):
     Choose a test point, say \(x = 0\).
     \[
     (0)^2 - 3(0) - 4 = -4 < 0
     \]
     So, the inequality does not hold in \((-1, 4)\).

   - For \(x \in (4, \infty)\):
     Choose a test point, say \(x = 5\).
     \[
     (5)^2 - 3(5) - 4 = 25 - 15 - 4 = 6 > 0
     \]
     So, the inequality holds in \((4, \infty)\).

4. **Combine the intervals where the inequality is satisfied:**
   The expression \(x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0\) is true for:
   \[
   x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty)
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   Therefore, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:
   \[
   (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty)
   \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:
