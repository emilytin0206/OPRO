"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's break down each option and apply relevant principles from electrostatics.

### Given:
- A nonconducting sphere with a net electric charge \( +Q \).
- A neutral conducting sphere of the same radius as the nonconducting sphere.

### Analysis:

1. **Option (A): An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
   - When a charged object is brought close to a conductor, an electric field is indeed induced in the conductor. This induced field tries to oppose the external field and can cause charges to rearrange themselves on the surface of the conductor.
   - However, this option does not specify what happens to the net charge or the interaction between the spheres.

2. **Option (B): The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
   - In a conductor, charges are free to move and rearrange themselves in response to an external field.
   - When the nonconducting sphere with \( +Q \) is brought close, the electrons in the neutral conducting sphere will be attracted towards the side closest to the charged sphere, leaving the other side with a net positive charge. This does not mean the entire conductor becomes negatively charged; rather, it develops an induced charge distribution.
   - Therefore, this option is incorrect because the net charge of the conducting sphere remains zero.

3. **Option (C): The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
   - A nonconducting sphere with a positive charge \( +Q \) will induce a negative charge on the side closest to it and a positive charge on the opposite side in the neutral conducting sphere.
   - This induced charge distribution creates an attractive force between the two spheres due to the opposite charges being closer together.

4. **Option (D): The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
   - As explained above, the induced charges create an attractive force rather than a repulsive one because of the opposite charges on the closest sides of each sphere.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is that the spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction due to the induced charge distribution in the conducting sphere.

**Final Answer: (C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**",1.0,"Analyze the question or problem thoroughly, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer based on the information provided.",17
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

So, we need to solve:

\[ (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \]

To find the intervals where this inequality holds true, we determine the roots of the equation \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

Next, we test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the inequality \( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \) is satisfied in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero, we exclude the points where the expression under the square root equals zero, which are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \). Therefore, the domain of the function is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

(C) \( (-\infty, -1) U (4, \infty) \)",1.0,"Analyze the question or problem thoroughly, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer based on the information provided.",17
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedent. The key points to analyze include:

1. **Nature of Declaratory Judgment**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that determines the rights and obligations between parties without ordering any specific action or awarding damages.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent**: The most relevant case here is likely *O'Shea v. Littleton* (414 U.S. 488, 1974), where the Supreme Court established that a declaratory judgment should not be granted if there is no actual or imminent controversy between the parties.

3. **Threat of Enforcement**: The law student's companions were arrested for criminal trespass and loitering, which suggests that these statutes are being enforced against individuals who engage in similar activities. This could imply a genuine threat to the law student as well.

4. **Speculative Nature of Fears**: While the law student fears future arrest, this fear must be grounded in more than mere speculation for a declaratory judgment to be granted. The existence of prior warnings and arrests provides some basis for these fears.

Given these points, let's evaluate each option:

- **Option (A)**: This suggests that the federal district court would dismiss the action because it interferes with existing state prosecutions. While this is a valid concern, Supreme Court precedent does not necessarily support an automatic dismissal based solely on interference with state proceedings.
  
- **Option (B)**: This states that a federal plaintiff may seek declaratory judgment even if not threatened by a state prosecution. However, the law student's situation involves more than just potential future threats; there is evidence of past enforcement actions.

- **Option (C)**: This option argues for granting the declaratory relief because the law student can show a genuine threat based on his companions' arrests and prior warnings. This aligns well with *O'Shea v. Littleton*, which requires a concrete threat to justify a declaratory judgment.
  
- **Option (D)**: This suggests that the declaratory relief would be premature due to speculative fears, but this overlooks the evidence of past enforcement actions.

Based on these considerations and Supreme Court precedent, the most precise answer is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly identifies that the law student's fears are not speculative but grounded in concrete evidence of past enforcement actions.",0.0,"Analyze the question or problem thoroughly, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer based on the information provided.",17
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the numbers without any remainder.

The given orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

To find the LCM, we can use their prime factorizations:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Finding the LCM**:
   The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in these factorizations.
   - For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Therefore, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Calculating this product step-by-step:
- First, calculate \(2^3\):
  \[ 2^3 = 8 \]
- Next, calculate \(3^3\):
  \[ 3^3 = 27 \]
- Then, calculate \(5^2\):
  \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

Now multiply these together:
\[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
\[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Thus, the least common multiple of 360, 450, and 540 is 5400.

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:
\[ \boxed{5400} \]

So, the correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,"Analyze the question or problem thoroughly, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer based on the information provided.",17
