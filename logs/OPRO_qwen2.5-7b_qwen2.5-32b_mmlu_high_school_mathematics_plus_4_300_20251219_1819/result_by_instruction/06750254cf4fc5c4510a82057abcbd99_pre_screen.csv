"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ E = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( E \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ E = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

Calculate step by step:
\[ E = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]
\[ E = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]
\[ E = 5 \times 10^{-2} J \]
\[ E = 0.05 J \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) 0.05 J",1.0,"Analyze the given information comprehensively, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",20
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider relevant legal principles, particularly those related to declaratory judgment actions and the conditions under which such actions can be brought in federal court.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a lawsuit filed by someone who wants a court to declare their rights or obligations under a specific set of circumstances. The primary purpose is to obtain legal clarity on the interpretation of laws, contracts, or other legal relationships without necessarily seeking any form of relief.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent**: The key Supreme Court case here is likely *O'Shea v. Littleton* (1980), which established that a declaratory judgment action cannot be brought to interfere with ongoing state prosecutions. This principle is based on the idea of comity and equity, ensuring that federal courts do not unnecessarily interfere with state judicial processes.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: This option aligns well with *O'Shea v. Littleton*. The arrest of the law student's companions for criminal trespass and loitering suggests ongoing state prosecutions which could be seen as interfering with these proceedings.
   - **Option B**: While a federal plaintiff may seek declaratory relief even if not directly threatened, this option does not address the interference with existing state prosecutions, which is a critical factor in *O'Shea v. Littleton*.
   - **Option C**: This option suggests that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings. However, the Supreme Court's stance in *O'Shea v. Littleton* focuses more on the interference with state prosecutions rather than the direct threat to the plaintiff.
   - **Option D**: This option argues that declaratory relief would be premature because of speculative fears. While this is a valid concern, it does not address the core issue of interfering with ongoing state proceedings.

Given these considerations and the Supreme Court precedent in *O'Shea v. Littleton*, the most accurate answer is:

**(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**

This option correctly identifies that the federal district court will likely dismiss the action due to the interference with ongoing state proceedings.",0.0,"Analyze the given information comprehensively, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",20
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the given scenario.

1. **Induced Electric Field (Option A):**
   - When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere. This is because the presence of the charged nonconducting sphere will cause charges in the conducting sphere to rearrange themselves due to electrostatic induction.

2. **Net Electric Charge on the Conducting Sphere (Option B):**
   - A neutral conducting sphere does not have a net charge, and when brought close to another charged object, it will redistribute its charges but will not acquire a net charge of –Q or +Q. Instead, it will develop induced charges that are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign on the side closest to the nonconducting sphere.

3. **Electrostatic Forces (Options C and D):**
   - The electrostatic force between two charged objects depends on their charges and the distance between them. Since the conducting sphere initially has no net charge, it will not have a net charge of –Q or +Q due to induction alone.
   - However, because the nonconducting sphere is positively charged (+Q), the side of the conducting sphere closest to it will develop an induced negative charge, and the far side will develop an induced positive charge. This setup results in an overall attractive force between the two spheres.

Given these considerations:

- Option A (An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere) is correct but not the most accurate answer for what happens next.
- Option B (The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q) is incorrect because the conducting sphere does not acquire a net charge; it redistributes charges.
- Option C (The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction) is correct based on the induced charges and their arrangement.
- Option D (The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion) is incorrect as there is no net charge on the conducting sphere that would cause repulsion.

Therefore, the most accurate answer from the provided options is:

**C. The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**

This conclusion aligns with the principles of electrostatic induction and the resulting forces between charged objects.",0.0,"Analyze the given information comprehensively, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",20
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, we factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

Next, we determine where this product is greater than zero. We find the roots of the equation:

\[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \]
\[ x = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1 \]

These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \). We test a point from each interval to determine where the expression is positive:

- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]

- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (x - 4)(x + 1) = (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Next, we need to ensure that the denominator is not zero. The denominator is:

\[ \sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 4} \]

This expression is defined and non-zero in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

Therefore, combining these results, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

\[ 2^3 = 8 \]
\[ 3^3 = 27 \]
\[ 5^2 = 25 \]

Multiplying these together:
\[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
\[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.
