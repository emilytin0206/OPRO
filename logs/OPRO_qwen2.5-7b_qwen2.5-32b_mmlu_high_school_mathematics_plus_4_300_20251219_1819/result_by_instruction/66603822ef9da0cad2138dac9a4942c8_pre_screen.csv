"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, determine where this product is greater than zero. The roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \) are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero and we have already ensured that it is positive in these intervals, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider principles from constitutional law, specifically related to declaratory judgment actions and the balance between federal and state interests.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a legal remedy that allows a court to declare the rights of parties without ordering any specific action or awarding damages. The primary purpose is to resolve legal uncertainties before they lead to actual disputes.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent and Federalism**: The Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of federalism, which involves respecting state sovereignty while ensuring that federal courts can provide necessary relief when there are genuine threats of enforcement against individuals.

3. **Equity and Comity**: Courts often consider equity (fairness) and comity (respect for other jurisdictions' laws) in deciding whether to grant declaratory relief. However, these considerations do not necessarily preclude a court from granting relief if the plaintiff can show a genuine threat of enforcement.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: This suggests that the federal district court would dismiss the action because it interferes with existing state prosecutions. While this is a valid concern, Supreme Court precedent has generally allowed for declaratory judgments in cases where there is a genuine threat of enforcement.
   - **Option B**: This option states that a plaintiff may seek declaratory judgment regardless of whether they are threatened by a state prosecution. However, the Supreme Court has recognized that federal courts should not issue advisory opinions and must have a case or controversy before them.
   - **Option C**: This suggests that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings. Given the Supreme Court's stance on declaratory judgments in cases involving imminent threats, this option seems more aligned with current legal principles.
   - **Option D**: This states that the relief would be premature because the plaintiff’s fears are speculative. While it is true that future enforcement cannot be guaranteed, the Supreme Court has allowed for declaratory judgments when there is a substantial risk of enforcement.

5. **Conclusion Based on Supreme Court Precedent**:
The most accurate answer based on Supreme Court precedent and principles of federalism would be:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly identifies that the law student has demonstrated a substantial risk of future enforcement, which is sufficient to justify seeking declaratory relief in federal court.",1.0,"Analyze the problem context thoroughly, apply relevant principles or calculations, eliminate incorrect options based on provided information, and select the most accurate answer.",4
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the given scenario.

1. **Induced Electric Field (Option A):**
   - When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere. This is because the presence of the charged nonconducting sphere will cause charges in the conducting sphere to rearrange themselves due to electrostatic induction.

2. **Net Electric Charge on the Conducting Sphere (Option B):**
   - The conducting sphere initially has no net charge, but when brought close to a positively charged object, it will not develop an equal and opposite charge of –Q. Instead, charges within the conductor will rearrange themselves such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. This means positive charges on the side facing the nonconducting sphere will be pushed away from the surface towards the back, while negative charges will move to the front.

3. **Electrostatic Forces (Options C and D):**
   - The electrostatic force between two objects depends on their charges and the distance between them. Since the conducting sphere initially has no net charge, it does not have a net electric field outside of itself in its neutral state. However, due to induction, there will be an induced negative charge distribution on the side facing the nonconducting sphere and a corresponding positive charge distribution on the opposite side.
   - The overall effect is that the conducting sphere will experience an attractive force towards the nonconducting sphere because the induced charges create an electric field that attracts the positive charge of the nonconducting sphere.

Given these considerations, we can conclude:

- **Option A** is correct in stating that an electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
- **Option B** is incorrect as the conducting sphere does not develop a net charge of –Q; instead, it redistributes its charges to induce fields.
- **Option C** is correct because the spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction due to the induced charges on the conducting sphere.

However, since we need to select the most accurate answer based on the options provided and considering that both A and C are true but only one must be chosen:

The best single choice from the given options would be:
**(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**

This is because it directly addresses the net effect of the interaction between the charged nonconducting sphere and the conducting sphere, which results in a net attractive force due to induced charges on the conductor.",1.0,"Analyze the problem context thoroughly, apply relevant principles or calculations, eliminate incorrect options based on provided information, and select the most accurate answer.",4
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:
