"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 0.005 J.",0.0,"Analyze the given problem thoroughly, apply relevant concepts or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer from those provided.",15
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

So, we need to solve:

\[ (x-4)(x+1) > 0 \]

To find where this inequality holds true, we determine the roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the inequality \( (x-4)(x+1) > 0 \) is satisfied in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

Next, we need to ensure that the denominator \( \sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 4} \neq 0 \). This condition is already met by excluding the points where the expression under the square root equals zero, which are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \).

Therefore, combining these results, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the given scenario.

1. **Induced Electric Field (Option A):**
   - When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere. This is because the presence of the charged nonconducting sphere will cause charges in the conducting sphere to rearrange themselves due to electrostatic induction.

2. **Net Electric Charge on the Conducting Sphere (Option B):**
   - The key point here is that a conductor can distribute its charge such that the electric field inside it is zero when no external fields are present, except for induced fields from nearby charges. When the nonconducting sphere with +Q is brought close to the neutral conducting sphere, the free electrons in the conducting sphere will be displaced towards the side of the sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere. This leaves a net positive charge on the opposite side of the conducting sphere. However, this does not mean that the overall net electric charge of the conducting sphere becomes -Q; it simply means there is an induced polarization.

3. **Electrostatic Forces (Options C and D):**
   - The electrostatic force between two charged objects depends on their charges and the distance between them. Since the nonconducting sphere has a positive charge +Q, and due to induction, one side of the conducting sphere will have a net positive charge while the other side will have an induced negative charge (though not enough to completely neutralize the overall neutrality). Therefore, there will be an attractive force between the two spheres because opposite charges attract.

Given these points:

- Option A is correct in that an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere.
- Option B is incorrect as the net charge of the conducting sphere does not become -Q; it becomes polarized but remains neutral overall.
- Options C and D are related to the nature of the force between the spheres, which would be attractive due to the induced charges.

Therefore, the most precise answer from the provided options is:

**(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**",1.0,"Analyze the given problem thoroughly, apply relevant concepts or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer from those provided.",15
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedents and the specific circumstances presented.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that determines the rights or obligations of parties without ordering any action other than the declaration itself. The primary purpose is to resolve legal disputes before they lead to actual harm.

2. **Supreme Court Precedents on Declaratory Judgments**:
   - In *Warth v. Seldin* (1975), the Supreme Court established that a declaratory judgment action must meet certain criteria, including a ""real and immediate"" threat of enforcement against the plaintiff.
   - In *Lesar v. Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co.* (1982), the Court further clarified that a declaratory judgment is not appropriate if it would interfere with ongoing state prosecutions.

3. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **Option A**: This option suggests that the declaratory relief would be dismissed due to interference with existing state prosecutions, which aligns with *Lesar v. Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co.* However, this does not fully consider the ""real and immediate"" threat criterion.
   - **Option B**: This is incorrect because it overlooks the need for a genuine threat of enforcement against the plaintiff as established in *Warth v. Seldin*.
   - **Option C**: This option correctly identifies that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement based on the arrest of his companions and prior warnings, aligning with the ""real and immediate"" threat criterion from *Warth v. Seldin*.
   - **Option D**: While this option mentions the speculative nature of future arrests, it does not address the ""real and immediate"" threat required for a declaratory judgment.

Given these considerations, the most precise answer is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly applies both the ""real and immediate"" threat criterion from *Warth v. Seldin* and acknowledges that the law student's situation meets this requirement despite not being directly threatened himself at the time of filing.",1.0,"Analyze the given problem thoroughly, apply relevant concepts or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer from those provided.",15
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

\[
2^3 = 8
\]
\[
3^3 = 27
\]
\[
5^2 = 25
\]

Multiplying these together:
\[
8 \times 27 = 216
\]
\[
216 \times 25 = 5400
\]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.

The correct answer is:
(B) 5400",1.0,"Analyze the given problem thoroughly, apply relevant concepts or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer from those provided.",15
