"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 0.005 J.",0.0,"Analyze the question or context thoroughly, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most accurate answer based on the given information.",15
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedents and the specific circumstances presented.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that determines the rights of parties without ordering any action or giving any relief beyond what is necessary to settle the matter at hand. The primary purpose is to resolve legal disputes before they lead to more serious consequences, such as criminal prosecution.

2. **Supreme Court Precedents on Declaratory Judgments**: In cases like *Warth v. Seldin* (1975), the Supreme Court established criteria for when a declaratory judgment action can be brought. These include:
   - A real and immediate controversy.
   - An actual, not merely hypothetical, dispute.
   - A substantial likelihood that the plaintiff will face enforcement of the statute in question.

3. **Analysis of Options**:

- **Option (A)**: This option suggests that declaratory relief would be disallowed due to interference with existing state prosecutions. While this is a valid concern, it does not directly address whether there's a real and immediate controversy or substantial likelihood of enforcement against the law student.
  
- **Option (B)**: This option states that a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute. However, this overlooks the need for a genuine threat of enforcement as established by Supreme Court precedents.

- **Option (C)**: This option correctly identifies that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on the arrest of his companions and prior warnings. The Supreme Court has recognized that such evidence can establish a substantial likelihood of future enforcement, which is sufficient for bringing a declaratory judgment action.
  
- **Option (D)**: This option suggests that the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears are speculative. While it acknowledges the speculative nature, it fails to consider the substantial threat of enforcement as evidenced by the arrest and warnings.

Given these considerations, the most accurate answer is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly applies Supreme Court precedent and acknowledges the real and immediate controversy that exists in this case.",0.0,"Analyze the question or context thoroughly, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most accurate answer based on the given information.",15
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, determine where this product is greater than zero. The roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \) are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero and we have already ensured that it is positive in these intervals, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(C) \((-inf, -1) U (4, inf)\).",1.0,"Analyze the question or context thoroughly, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most accurate answer based on the given information.",15
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this question, let's break down the scenario and apply relevant principles from electrostatics.

1. **Initial Setup**: We have a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius.

2. **Induced Charges in Conductors**:
   - When a charged object is placed near a conductor, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. The side of the conductor closest to the charged object will develop an induced negative charge, and the far side will develop an induced positive charge.
   
3. **Electric Field within the Conductor**: In a conductor at electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside must be zero because free charges can move until they cancel any internal fields.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - (A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere: This is true due to the induction process.
   - (B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q: This is incorrect because the total charge on the conductor must remain zero in an isolated system. Only the distribution of charges changes, not the overall charge.
   - (C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction: Since one sphere has a positive charge and the other develops an induced negative charge near it, there will be an attractive force between them due to opposite charges.
   - (D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion: This is incorrect because the charges are of opposite signs, leading to attraction rather than repulsion.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the principles of electrostatics and induction in conductors, the correct answer is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the given information is (C).",0.0,"Analyze the question or context thoroughly, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most accurate answer based on the given information.",15
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:

\[
\boxed{5400}
