"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the context provided and apply relevant legal principles. The key points in this scenario include:

1. **Nature of the Action**: The law student is seeking declaratory relief regarding the constitutionality of criminal statutes.
2. **Existing Prosecutions**: His companions have already been arrested for criminal trespass and loitering, indicating that there are ongoing state prosecutions related to these charges.
3. **Supreme Court Precedent**: Specifically, we need to consider how the Supreme Court has ruled on declaratory judgment actions in relation to existing state prosecutions.

### Analysis of Each Option:

- **Option (A)**: This option suggests that the federal district court would dismiss the action because it interferes with ongoing state prosecutions. The principle here is equity and comity, which means respecting the sovereignty of state courts and avoiding interference where possible.
  
- **Option (B)**: This option states that a federal plaintiff can seek declaratory relief even if not directly threatened by a state prosecution. However, this does not address the issue of existing prosecutions.

- **Option (C)**: This option argues that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings. While this might be true in terms of showing a credible fear, it doesn't directly address whether declaratory relief is appropriate given ongoing state proceedings.

- **Option (D)**: This option suggests that the action would be premature because the law student's fears are speculative. The Supreme Court has generally been cautious about issuing declaratory judgments when there is no immediate or imminent threat of enforcement.

### Application of Legal Principles:

The key legal principle here is whether a declaratory judgment can issue in the absence of an actual case or controversy, which is often tested by the ""case or controversy"" requirement. The Supreme Court has held that declaratory relief should not be granted when there is no immediate and concrete threat of enforcement.

### Conclusion:

Given the context and legal principles, **Option (A)** best aligns with the Supreme Court's stance on declaratory judgments in relation to existing state prosecutions. The court would likely dismiss the action because it interferes with ongoing state proceedings and does not present an actual case or controversy regarding the law student himself.

**Final Answer: (A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**",0.0,"Analyze the context thoroughly, apply relevant principles or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer based on the given information.",5
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a capacitor, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

Calculate step by step:
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-2} J \]
\[ U = 0.05 J \]

"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, determine where this product is greater than zero. The roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \) are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero and we have already ensured that it is positive in these intervals, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the given scenario.

1. **Induced Electric Field (Option A):**
   - When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, an electric field will indeed be induced within the conducting sphere. This is because the presence of the charged nonconducting sphere will cause charges in the conducting sphere to rearrange themselves due to electrostatic induction.

2. **Net Electric Charge on the Conducting Sphere (Option B):**
   - The conducting sphere initially has no net charge, but when brought close to a positively charged object, it will not acquire an equal and opposite charge of –Q. Instead, charges within the conductor will rearrange themselves such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. This means positive charges on the side facing the nonconducting sphere will be pushed away from the surface towards the back, while negative charges will move to the front.

3. **Electrostatic Forces Between the Spheres (Options C and D):**
   - The key here is understanding that a neutral conducting sphere will develop an induced charge distribution but not necessarily acquire a net charge of –Q as stated in Option B.
   - Since the nonconducting sphere has a positive charge +Q, it will induce negative charges on the side facing the nonconducting sphere and positive charges on the opposite side. This setup results in an overall attractive force between the two spheres due to the induced dipole moment.

Given these points:

- Option A is correct because an electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
- Option B is incorrect as the conducting sphere does not acquire a net charge of –Q; it develops a distribution of charges that results in an overall attractive force.
- Options C and D are related to the nature of the interaction but need clarification: The spheres experience an electrostatic attraction due to the induced charges, making Option C correct.

Therefore, based on the principles of electrostatics and the behavior of conductors in the presence of charged objects:

The most precise answer is (C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",1.0,"Analyze the context thoroughly, apply relevant principles or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer based on the given information.",5
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:
