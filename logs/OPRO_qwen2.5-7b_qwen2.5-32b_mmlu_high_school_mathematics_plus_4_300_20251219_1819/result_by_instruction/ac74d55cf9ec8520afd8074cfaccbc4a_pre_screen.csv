"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedent. The key points to analyze include:

1. **Nature of Declaratory Judgment**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that determines the rights and obligations of parties without ordering any specific action or awarding damages.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent**: The most relevant case here is *O'Shea v. Littleton* (414 U.S. 488, 1974), where the Supreme Court established that a declaratory judgment will not be granted if there is no actual or imminent controversy between the parties.

3. **Threat of Enforcement**: The law student's companions were arrested for criminal trespass and loitering, which suggests that these statutes are being enforced against individuals who engage in similar activities. This could imply a genuine threat to the law student as well.

4. **Speculative Nature of Fears**: While the law student fears future arrest based on prior warnings and his companions' arrests, this fear alone might not be sufficient to establish an actual controversy if there is no concrete evidence or imminent danger of enforcement against him specifically.

Given these points:

- Option (A) suggests that declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions. This is a valid concern but does not directly address the Supreme Court's stance on the necessity of an actual or imminent controversy.
  
- Option (B) states that a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution, which is generally true but does not fully consider the need for an actual or imminent threat.

- Option (C) indicates that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on his companions' arrests and prior warnings. This aligns well with *O'Shea v. Littleton* as it suggests there is a concrete risk to the law student, which could support an actual controversy.

- Option (D) argues that declaratory relief would be premature because the fears are speculative. While this might seem plausible, it does not fully consider the evidence of prior enforcement actions against his companions and the warnings received.

Considering these points, the most accurate answer is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly identifies that there is sufficient evidence to establish an actual or imminent controversy, which aligns with Supreme Court precedent on declaratory judgments.",0.0,"Analyze the question or problem statement thoroughly, apply necessary concepts or calculations, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most accurate answer based on the provided information.",17
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work required),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, determine where this product is greater than zero. The roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \) are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
- For \( x < -1 \): Choose \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero and we have already ensured that it is positive in these intervals, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's break down each option and apply our understanding of electrostatics.

### Given:
- A nonconducting sphere with a net electric charge \( +Q \).
- A neutral conducting sphere of the same radius as the nonconducting sphere.

### Analysis:

1. **Option (A): An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
   - When a charged object is brought close to a conductor, an electric field is indeed induced in the conductor. This induced field tries to oppose the external field and can cause charges to rearrange themselves on the surface of the conductor.
   - However, this option does not directly address what happens to the net charge or interaction between the spheres.

2. **Option (B): The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
   - In a conductor, charges are free to move and rearrange themselves on the surface in response to an external field.
   - When the nonconducting sphere with \( +Q \) is brought close, the electrons in the neutral conducting sphere will be attracted towards the side closest to the charged sphere, leaving the other side with a net positive charge. This does not mean the entire conductor becomes negatively charged; rather, it develops an induced charge distribution.
   - Therefore, this option is incorrect.

3. **Option (C): The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
   - A nonconducting sphere with \( +Q \) and a conducting sphere that has developed an induced charge distribution due to the presence of the charged sphere will experience an attractive force because opposite charges attract.
   - This is correct based on Coulomb's law, which states that opposite charges attract.

4. **Option (D): The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
   - Since one sphere has a net positive charge and the other develops induced charges but does not become uniformly negatively charged overall, there would be no uniform repulsive force between them.
   - This is incorrect because of the nature of the induced charges.

### Conclusion:
The most accurate answer based on the provided information is:

**Option (C): The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**

This conclusion is drawn from the understanding that a positive charge and an induced negative charge distribution will result in an attractive force between the two spheres.",0.0,"Analyze the question or problem statement thoroughly, apply necessary concepts or calculations, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most accurate answer based on the provided information.",17
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:

\[
\boxed{5400}
