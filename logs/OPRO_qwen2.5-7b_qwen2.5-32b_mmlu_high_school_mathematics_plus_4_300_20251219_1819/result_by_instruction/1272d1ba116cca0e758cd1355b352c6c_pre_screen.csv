"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

Calculate step by step:
1. Calculate \( V^2 \):
   \[ V^2 = (100 V)^2 = 10000 V^2 \]
   
2. Multiply the capacitance by \( V^2 \):
   \[ C \times V^2 = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \times 10000 V^2 = 10 \times 10^{-2} J = 0.1 J \]
   
3. Finally, multiply by \( \frac{1}{2} \):
   \[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.1 J = 0.05 J \]

Therefore, the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V is:

\[ \boxed{0.05 J} \]

So, the correct answer is (C) 0.05 J.",1.0,"Analyze the given information deeply, apply necessary concepts or calculations, eliminate incorrect options methodically, and choose the most accurate answer based on the provided details.",4
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider several legal principles related to declaratory judgment actions, particularly as they pertain to federal court jurisdiction and the standards for granting such relief.

1. **Declaratory Judgment Act (DJA) and Federal Jurisdiction**: The Declaratory Judgment Act allows a party to seek a declaration of their rights or status from a court without necessarily having an actual controversy that would otherwise require a lawsuit. However, there must be a ""case or controversy"" as required by Article III of the U.S. Constitution.

2. **Existing Prosecutions and Equitable Considerations**: The Supreme Court has held in cases such as *Los Angeles County Bar Ass'n v. Superior Court* (1980) that declaratory relief may not be granted if it would interfere with ongoing state prosecutions or otherwise disrupt the normal functioning of the state judicial system.

3. **Threat of Enforcement and Future Controversies**: The Supreme Court has also established in cases like *Warth v. Seldin* (1975) that a plaintiff must show a genuine threat of enforcement against them to have standing to seek declaratory relief, even if the threat is based on past actions.

Given these principles:

- **Option A** suggests that the federal district court would dismiss the action because it interferes with existing state prosecutions. This could be correct under certain circumstances but requires careful consideration.
  
- **Option B** states that a plaintiff may seek declaratory judgment even if not threatened by a state prosecution, which is generally true but does not address the specific issue of interference with ongoing state proceedings.

- **Option C** indicates that the law student can show a genuine threat based on his companions' arrest and prior warnings. This aligns well with the requirement for a ""case or controversy"" and the need to demonstrate a real, imminent threat.

- **Option D** suggests dismissal due to speculative fears of future arrest, which is not accurate because the law student has shown concrete actions by the police against his friends and previous warnings.

Considering these points, the most accurate answer based on Supreme Court precedent would be:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly identifies that the law student has demonstrated a concrete basis for seeking declaratory relief, which is sufficient to establish standing in federal court under the circumstances described.",1.0,"Analyze the given information deeply, apply necessary concepts or calculations, eliminate incorrect options methodically, and choose the most accurate answer based on the provided details.",4
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the given scenario.

1. **Nonconducting Sphere with +Q Charge**: This sphere has a net positive charge of +Q. When brought close to another object (in this case, a neutral conducting sphere), it will induce charges on the surface of the conducting sphere due to the electric field created by the nonconducting sphere.

2. **Neutral Conducting Sphere**: A conductor distributes its charge such that the electric field inside is zero. This means any external electric field will cause the free electrons in the conductor to move and rearrange themselves until they cancel out the external field within the conductor.

3. **Induced Charges on the Conducting Sphere**:
   - When a positive charge (+Q) approaches, it repels the free electrons in the conducting sphere towards one side of the sphere.
   - This leaves the other side with an excess of protons (positive charges), creating a net negative charge on that side.

4. **Electrostatic Forces Between Spheres**:
   - The induced positive charge on the side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere will attract the +Q charge.
   - However, the overall effect is such that there is an attractive force between the two spheres due to the redistribution of charges.

Now let's evaluate each option:

(A) **An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
- This statement is incorrect because in a conductor, the electric field inside must be zero for electrostatic equilibrium. The charges rearrange themselves on the surface but do not create an internal electric field.

(B) **The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
- This is also incorrect. While there will be induced negative charges on one side and positive charges on the other, these charges are distributed over the entire surface of the conductor in such a way that the net charge remains zero due to the neutrality of the material.

(C) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
- This is correct. The nonconducting sphere with +Q will induce a negative charge on one side of the conducting sphere, creating an attractive force between them.

(D) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
- This is incorrect because the induced charges create an attractive force rather than a repulsive one.

Therefore, based on the analysis and principles of electrostatics, the most accurate answer is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",0.0,"Analyze the given information deeply, apply necessary concepts or calculations, eliminate incorrect options methodically, and choose the most accurate answer based on the provided details.",4
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

So, we need to solve:

\[ (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \]

To find the intervals where this inequality holds true, we determine the roots of the equation \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

Next, we test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the inequality \( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \) is satisfied in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero, we exclude the points where the expression under the square root equals zero, which are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \). Therefore, these points must also be excluded from the domain.

Combining all this information, the domain of the function is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3\):
   \[ 2^3 = 8 \]

2. Calculate \(3^3\):
   \[ 3^3 = 27 \]

3. Calculate \(5^2\):
   \[ 5^2 = 25 \]

4. Multiply these together:
   \[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
   \[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.
