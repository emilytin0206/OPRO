"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider relevant legal principles, particularly those related to declaratory judgment actions and the standards for obtaining such relief. The key Supreme Court precedent here is likely derived from the Declaratory Judgment Act (D.J.A.) of 1934, which allows federal courts to issue a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations whether or not further relief is sought.

The most relevant case in this context would be **Parden v. Terminal Railway of Alabama State Port Authority** (1965), where the Supreme Court held that a state official could seek declaratory judgment on the constitutionality of a state statute even if he was not personally threatened with prosecution under it, provided there is a ""real and immediate"" threat.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) **Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**
- This option suggests that the federal court should dismiss the action because it might interfere with ongoing state proceedings. However, this reasoning is not supported by the Supreme Court's precedent in cases like Parden v. Terminal Railway.

(B) **No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.**
- This option incorrectly states that the law student can file for declaratory relief without any threat of enforcement against him. The Supreme Court's precedent requires more than just a hypothetical fear; there must be a ""real and immediate"" threat.

(C) **No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**
- This option correctly identifies that the law student has shown a real and immediate threat through the arrests of his friends and previous warnings from the police. The Supreme Court's precedent supports seeking declaratory relief when there is such a threat.

(D) **Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.**
- This option suggests that the action should be dismissed due to the speculative nature of the law student’s fears. However, the Supreme Court has recognized that a ""real and immediate"" threat is sufficient for seeking declaratory relief.

Given these analyses, the most accurate answer based on the provided information and relevant legal principles is:

**C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option correctly applies the Supreme Court's precedent in cases like Parden v. Terminal Railway, which allows for declaratory relief when there is a real and immediate threat of enforcement.",0.0,"Analyze the given context deeply, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options methodically based on provided information, and select the most accurate answer from those available.",11
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ E = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( E \) is the energy (work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ E = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

Calculate step by step:
\[ E = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]
\[ E = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]
\[ E = 5 \times 10^{-2} J \]
\[ E = 0.05 J \]

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved in electrostatics and how they apply to the given scenario.

1. **Nonconducting Sphere with +Q Charge**: This sphere has a net positive charge of +Q. When brought close to another object (in this case, a neutral conducting sphere), it will induce charges on the surface of the conducting sphere due to the electric field created by the nonconducting sphere.

2. **Neutral Conducting Sphere**: A conductor distributes its charge such that the electric field inside is zero. This means any external electric field will cause the free electrons in the conductor to move and rearrange themselves until they cancel out the external field within the conductor.

3. **Induced Charges on the Conducting Sphere**:
   - When a positive charge (+Q) approaches, it repels the free electrons in the conducting sphere towards one side of the sphere.
   - This leaves the other side with an excess of protons (positive charges), creating a net negative charge on that side.

4. **Electrostatic Forces Between Spheres**:
   - The induced positive charge on the side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere will attract the +Q charge.
   - However, due to the overall neutral nature and the distribution of charges, there is no net repulsion or attraction between the spheres based solely on their induced charges.

Now let's evaluate each option:

(A) **An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
- This statement is true because when a nonconducting charged object approaches a conductor, it induces an electric field that causes charge redistribution in the conductor.

(B) **The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
- This is incorrect. The conducting sphere does not gain or lose any net charge; instead, charges are redistributed on its surface due to induction.

(C) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
- While there might be local attractive forces between the induced positive and negative charges, the overall interaction between the two spheres (considering their net charges) is neutral because the conducting sphere remains electrically neutral in terms of net charge.

(D) **The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
- This is also incorrect for the same reason as option C; there is no net repulsive force due to the overall neutrality of the conducting sphere.

Given this analysis, the most accurate answer based on the principles of electrostatics and induction in conductors is:

(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.",0.0,"Analyze the given context deeply, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options methodically based on provided information, and select the most accurate answer from those available.",11
"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) \]

So, we need to solve:

\[ (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \]

To find the intervals where this inequality holds true, we determine the roots of the equation \( (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

Next, we test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \): Choose \( x = -2 \)
  \[ (-2 - 4)(-2 + 1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \): Choose \( x = 0 \)
  \[ (0 - 4)(0 + 1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \): Choose \( x = 5 \)
  \[ (5 - 4)(5 + 1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the inequality \( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \) is satisfied in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero, we exclude the points where the expression under the square root equals zero, which are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \). Therefore, these points must also be excluded from the domain.

Combining all this information, the domain of the function is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers without any remainder.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

Let's calculate the LCM step-by-step:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Identify the Highest Powers of Each Prime**:
   - For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

3. **Calculate LCM**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2
   \]
   \[
   = 8 \times 27 \times 25
   \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication**:
   - First, multiply \(8\) and \(27\):
     \[
     8 \times 27 = 216
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by \(25\):
     \[
     216 \times 25 = 5400
     \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is **5400**.

The correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,"Analyze the given context deeply, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options methodically based on provided information, and select the most accurate answer from those available.",11
