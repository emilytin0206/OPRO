"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the numerator and the denominator are defined. Specifically, for the square root in the denominator, the expression inside must be positive because the square root of a negative number is not real, and division by zero is undefined.

Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. **Identify where the denominator is defined:**
   The denominator is \(\sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 4}\). For the expression under the square root to be defined (and positive), we need:
   \[
   x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0
   \]

2. **Solve the inequality \(x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0\):**
   First, solve the equation \(x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0\) to find the critical points.
   \[
   x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) = 0
   \]
   So, the roots are:
   \[
   x = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -1
   \]

3. **Determine the intervals where \(x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0\):**
   The critical points divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -1)\), \((-1, 4)\), and \((4, \infty)\). We test a point in each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

   - For \(x \in (-\infty, -1)\):
     Choose \(x = -2\):
     \[
     (-2)^2 - 3(-2) - 4 = 4 + 6 - 4 = 6 > 0
     \]
     So, the inequality holds in \((-\infty, -1)\).

   - For \(x \in (-1, 4)\):
     Choose \(x = 0\):
     \[
     0^2 - 3(0) - 4 = -4 < 0
     \]
     So, the inequality does not hold in \((-1, 4)\).

   - For \(x \in (4, \infty)\):
     Choose \(x = 5\):
     \[
     5^2 - 3(5) - 4 = 25 - 15 - 4 = 6 > 0
     \]
     So, the inequality holds in \((4, \infty)\).

4. **Combine the intervals where the inequality is satisfied:**
   The expression \(x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0\) is true for:
   \[
   x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty)
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   Therefore, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:
   \[
   (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty)
   \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 0.005 J.",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement meticulously, use relevant theories or calculations as required, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer from those provided based on the given information.",15
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider relevant legal principles, particularly those established by the U.S. Supreme Court regarding declaratory judgment actions and their relation to pending or threatened state prosecutions.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that determines the rights of parties without ordering any action or providing relief. The primary purpose is to resolve legal disputes before they lead to more serious consequences, such as criminal prosecution.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent on Declaratory Judgments and State Prosecutions**:
   - In *Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman* (1981), the Supreme Court held that a declaratory judgment action cannot be used to interfere with ongoing or threatened state prosecutions.
   - The principle of ""equity and comity"" suggests that federal courts should not issue orders that would disrupt the normal functioning of state criminal justice systems.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - (A) This option aligns well with the principles established in *Pennhurst*. It correctly identifies that declaratory relief could interfere with existing state prosecutions, thus justifying a dismissal.
   - (B) This is incorrect because it suggests that a federal plaintiff can always seek declaratory judgment regardless of whether they are threatened by a state prosecution. This conflicts with Supreme Court precedent.
   - (C) While the arrest of companions and prior warnings might indicate a genuine threat to the law student, this does not override the principle that declaratory judgments should not interfere with ongoing or threatened state prosecutions.
   - (D) This option suggests premature relief but does not address the core issue of interference with state prosecutions.

Given these considerations, the most precise answer is:

**(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.**

This choice correctly applies Supreme Court precedent to the scenario presented.",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement meticulously, use relevant theories or calculations as required, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer from those provided based on the given information.",15
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To solve this problem, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option (A): An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
   - When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, an electric field due to the presence of the charged nonconducting sphere will indeed induce charges on the surface of the conducting sphere.
   - However, in a conductor, these induced charges will rearrange themselves such that the internal electric field within the conductor becomes zero. This means there won't be any net charge distribution inside the conducting sphere.

2. **Option (B): The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
   - In a conductor, charges can only reside on the surface and cannot accumulate in the interior due to the free movement of electrons.
   - Therefore, while there might be induced positive charges on one side and negative charges on the other side of the conducting sphere's surface, these will not result in a net charge of –Q. The total charge remains zero.

3. **Option (C): The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
   - A positively charged nonconducting sphere will induce a separation of charges within the neutral conducting sphere.
   - On the side closer to the nonconducting sphere, there will be a concentration of negative charges and on the opposite side, positive charges.
   - This setup creates an attractive force between the two spheres due to the induced dipole moment.

4. **Option (D): The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
   - As explained in option (C), the induced charges create a configuration that results in an attractive force rather than a repulsive one.

Based on this analysis, the most accurate statement is:

**The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**

Therefore, the correct answer is **(C)**.",1.0,"Analyze the problem statement meticulously, use relevant theories or calculations as required, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer from those provided based on the given information.",15
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

\[
2^3 = 8
\]
\[
3^3 = 27
\]
\[
5^2 = 25
\]

Multiplying these together:
\[
8 \times 27 = 216
\]
\[
216 \times 25 = 5400
\]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is:

\(\boxed{5400}\)

So, the correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,"Analyze the problem statement meticulously, use relevant theories or calculations as required, eliminate incorrect options logically, and select the most precise answer from those provided based on the given information.",15
