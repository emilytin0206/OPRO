"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"Let's analyze each option carefully in relation to the problem statement:

(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
- When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, the charges in the conducting sphere will rearrange due to the influence of the external electric field. This rearrangement results in an induced electric field within the conducting sphere. Therefore, this statement is true.

(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
- A conducting sphere cannot have a net charge because any excess charge on a conductor distributes itself uniformly over its surface and the total charge must be zero if it were neutral initially (ignoring induced charges for now). However, due to induction, there will be an equal amount of positive and negative charges induced. The overall net charge remains 0, but there is a redistribution of charges. Therefore, this statement is not accurate as the conducting sphere does not develop a net electric charge of –Q.

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
- Since one sphere has a net positive charge +Q and the other (due to induction) will have a net negative charge on its surface, there will be an attractive force between them. Therefore, this statement is true.

(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.
- Given that one sphere is positively charged and the induced charges on the conducting sphere will create a net negative charge on its surface, these opposite charges attract each other, not repel. Thus, this statement is false.

Considering all options:

The most accurate answer based on the analysis is (C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",0.0,"Analyze each option carefully in relation to the problem statement, eliminate incorrect choices logically, and select the most accurate answer.",2
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

Calculate step by step:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-2} J \]
\[ U = 0.05 J \]

"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers, and the denominator cannot be zero.
2. We need to solve the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

First, let's factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

Next, we find the roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \), which are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

We need to test each interval to determine where the expression is positive:
- For \( x < -1 \): Choose a test point, say \( x = -2 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \).
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose a test point, say \( x = 0 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \).
- For \( x > 4 \): Choose a test point, say \( x = 5 \). Then, \( (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \).

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \) is true for \( x < -1 \) and \( x > 4 \). Therefore, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:
\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

So, the correct answer is:

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"The correct answer is (C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.

Here’s an analysis of each option:

(A) This option suggests that declaratory relief would be dismissed due to interference with existing state prosecutions. However, Supreme Court precedent does not support dismissing such actions solely based on equity and comity when a plaintiff can demonstrate a genuine threat of enforcement against them. Therefore, this is incorrect.

(B) While it's true that federal plaintiffs may seek declaratory judgments without being directly threatened by state prosecutions, the law student’s situation involves more than just potential future prosecution; there are existing threats as evidenced by his companions' arrest and prior warnings from the police. This makes option (B) less accurate in this context.

(C) This is the most accurate answer because it correctly identifies that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, which aligns with Supreme Court precedent allowing declaratory judgments when there is a real and immediate threat of enforcement. The arrest of his companions and prior warnings from the police provide sufficient evidence to support this claim.

(D) This option incorrectly states that the relief would be premature due to speculative fears. While it's true that future arrests are speculative, the law student can base his request on existing threats and actions by the police, making a declaratory judgment action timely and appropriate under Supreme Court precedent.

Therefore, based on the analysis of each option in relation to the problem statement and relevant legal principles, the most accurate answer is (C).",1.0,"Analyze each option carefully in relation to the problem statement, eliminate incorrect choices logically, and select the most accurate answer.",2
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the numbers without any remainder.

The given orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

Let's find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Finding the LCM**:
   The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations.
   - For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Therefore, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 = 8 \times 27 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Thus, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.
