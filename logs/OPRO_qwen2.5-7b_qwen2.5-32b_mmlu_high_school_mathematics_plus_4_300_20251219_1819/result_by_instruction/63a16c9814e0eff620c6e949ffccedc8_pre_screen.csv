"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality \( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \).

### Step 1: Factorize the quadratic expression
First, we factorize the quadratic equation:
\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

### Step 2: Determine where the factors are zero
Set each factor to zero to find the critical points:
\[ x - 4 = 0 \implies x = 4 \]
\[ x + 1 = 0 \implies x = -1 \]

These points divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 3: Test each interval
We need to determine where the product \((x-4)(x+1)\) is positive. We can test a point in each interval:

- For \( x \in (-\infty, -1) \), choose \( x = -2 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0 \]

- For \( x \in (-1, 4) \), choose \( x = 0 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x \in (4, \infty) \), choose \( x = 5 \):
  \[ (x-4)(x+1) = (5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0 \]

### Step 4: Combine the results
The expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \) is positive in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

### Step 5: Consider the denominator
Since the function includes a square root in the denominator, we must ensure that the expression inside the square root is strictly greater than zero. Therefore, we exclude the points where it equals zero:
\[ x = -1 \text{ and } x = 4 \]

Thus, the domain of \( f(x) \) is the union of the intervals where the expression is positive:
\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

### Conclusion
The correct answer is:

"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 0.005 J.",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement in detail, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on the given information, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",19
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To analyze this problem statement, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedent. The key points here involve the nature and scope of declaratory relief, as well as the conditions under which such relief can be granted.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a court order that determines the rights of parties without ordering any action or providing for monetary damages. It's often used to clarify legal relationships between parties.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent and Declaratory Judgments**: The Supreme Court has established certain criteria for when a federal court can grant declaratory relief, especially in cases involving state laws. One of the key principles is that the plaintiff must show a ""genuine threat"" or ""real danger of immediate and irreparable injury.""

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option (A)**: This option suggests that the declaratory relief would be dismissed due to interference with existing state prosecutions, citing equity and comity. However, this is not necessarily true based on Supreme Court precedent. The Supreme Court has allowed declaratory judgments even when there are ongoing state proceedings.
   
   - **Option (B)**: This option states that a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment regardless of whether they are threatened with a state prosecution. While this statement is generally correct, it does not fully address the specific circumstances presented in the problem.

   - **Option (C)**: This option argues that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on the arrest of his companions and prior warnings. Given the Supreme Court's criteria for granting declaratory relief, this is a strong argument because it demonstrates a ""real danger"" or ""immediate and irreparable injury.""

   - **Option (D)**: This option claims that the declaratory relief would be premature due to speculative fears of future arrest. While the law student’s fears are not entirely without basis, they might still be considered too speculative for immediate relief under some interpretations.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on Supreme Court precedent and the specific circumstances provided in the problem statement, the most accurate answer is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option aligns with the legal standards for granting declaratory relief, particularly when there is a clear indication that the plaintiff faces a real risk of future harm due to state actions.",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement in detail, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on the given information, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",19
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding the Initial Setup**:
   - We have a nonconducting sphere with a net electric charge +Q.
   - A neutral conducting sphere of the same radius is brought close to the charged nonconducting sphere.

2. **Electric Field and Induction in Conductors**:
   - When a charged object (in this case, the nonconducting sphere) approaches a conductor, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor.
   - In a conductor, free electrons can move freely under the influence of an electric field. This movement results in the redistribution of charges such that the net electric field inside the conductor is zero.

3. **Induced Charges**:
   - The nonconducting sphere with charge +Q will induce a negative charge on one side and a positive charge on the other side of the conducting sphere.
   - Since the conducting sphere was initially neutral, these induced charges will be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to maintain electrical neutrality overall.

4. **Analyzing Each Option**:
   - (A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere: This is not correct because, as mentioned earlier, the net electric field inside a conductor must be zero due to the free movement of charges.
   - (B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q: This is incorrect. While there will be an induced negative charge on one side and positive on the other, the total charge remains zero because the conductor as a whole is still neutral.
   - (C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction: This is correct. A positively charged nonconducting sphere will attract a negatively charged region of the conducting sphere, leading to an attractive force between them.
   - (D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion: This is incorrect because opposite charges attract, not repel.

5. **Conclusion**:
   Based on the analysis and understanding of how conductors behave in the presence of external electric fields, the correct answer is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.

This conclusion aligns with the principles of electrostatic induction and the behavior of charged objects near conductors.",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement in detail, apply relevant theories or calculations as needed, eliminate incorrect options based on the given information, and select the most accurate answer from those provided.",19
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers without any remainder.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Identify the Highest Powers of Each Prime**:
   - For \(2\): The highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\): The highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\): The highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

3. **Calculate the LCM**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2
   \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     - \(2^3 = 8\)
     - \(3^3 = 27\)
     - \(5^2 = 25\)

4. **Multiply the Results**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 8 \times 27 \times 25
   \]
   - First, multiply 8 and 27:
     \[
     8 \times 27 = 216
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by 25:
     \[
     216 \times 25 = 5400
     \]

Thus, the least common multiple of 360, 450, and 540 is 5400.

### Conclusion:

The minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days. Therefore, the correct answer is:

\boxed{B}
