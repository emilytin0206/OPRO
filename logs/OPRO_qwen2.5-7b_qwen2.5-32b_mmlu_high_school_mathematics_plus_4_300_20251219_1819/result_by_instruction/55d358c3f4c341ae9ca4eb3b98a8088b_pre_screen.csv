"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider principles from constitutional law, specifically related to declaratory judgment actions and the balance between federal and state interests.

1. **Understanding Declaratory Judgment Actions**: A declaratory judgment is a legal remedy that allows a court to declare the rights of parties without ordering any specific action or awarding damages. The primary purpose is to resolve legal uncertainties before they lead to actual disputes.

2. **Supreme Court Precedent and Federalism**: The Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of federalism, which involves respecting state sovereignty while ensuring that federal courts can provide necessary relief when there are genuine threats of enforcement against individuals.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: This option suggests dismissing the action due to interference with existing state prosecutions and concerns about equity and comity (respect for state laws). However, this reasoning is not directly supported by Supreme Court precedent in the context of declaratory judgments.
   
   - **Option B**: This option states that a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if they are not threatened with a state prosecution. While this might be true in some contexts, it does not address the specific circumstances where there is a genuine threat to the plaintiff's rights as evidenced by prior warnings and arrests.
   
   - **Option C**: This option correctly identifies that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him based on the arrest of his companions and previous warnings. The Supreme Court has recognized that declaratory judgments are appropriate when there is a ""genuine"" or ""real and immediate"" threat to the plaintiff's rights.
   
   - **Option D**: This option suggests dismissing the action as premature because the law student’s fears are speculative. However, the existence of prior warnings and arrests provides a concrete basis for the fear of future enforcement.

4. **Conclusion Based on Supreme Court Precedent**:
Given that the Supreme Court has recognized the importance of providing declaratory relief when there is a genuine threat to an individual's rights (as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and previous warnings), the most accurate answer is:

**(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.**

This option aligns with the principles that federal courts should provide declaratory relief when there are concrete threats to individual rights, even if those threats arise from state actions.",1.0,"Analyze the provided details meticulously, apply relevant principles or perform necessary calculations as required by the question context, eliminate incorrect options logically based on your analysis, and select the most accurate answer from those given.",20
"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved:

1. **Induced Electric Field in Conductors**: When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, the electric field from the nonconducting sphere will induce charges on the surface of the conducting sphere.

2. **Charge Induction and Distribution**: In a conductor, free electrons can move freely under the influence of an external electric field. When the nonconducting sphere with +Q is brought close to the neutral conducting sphere, the side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting sphere will experience a higher electric field due to the presence of the positive charge. This causes the free electrons in the conductor to move away from this region towards the opposite side of the sphere.

3. **Charge Distribution**: As a result, an equal and opposite charge –Q will be induced on the side of the conducting sphere that is closest to the nonconducting sphere with +Q. The far side of the conducting sphere will have a net positive charge +Q due to the redistribution of electrons.

4. **Electrostatic Forces Between Spheres**: Since one sphere has a net positive charge and the other has an induced negative charge on its near surface, there will be an electrostatic attraction between them.

Now let's evaluate each option:

(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
- This is true because the electric field from the nonconducting sphere induces charges in the conductor. However, this does not directly answer what happens to the overall charge distribution or interaction forces.

(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
- This is incorrect because while there is an induced negative charge on one side, the total charge of the conducting sphere remains zero due to the redistribution of charges. The net charge does not change from neutral.

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
- This is correct based on the principle that opposite charges attract each other.

(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.
- This is incorrect because there are no like charges (both positive or both negative) between the two spheres to cause repulsion. Instead, there is a net attractive force due to the induced charge distribution.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the principles and analysis is:

(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",0.0,"Analyze the provided details meticulously, apply relevant principles or perform necessary calculations as required by the question context, eliminate incorrect options logically based on your analysis, and select the most accurate answer from those given.",20
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (work required),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\( C \)) = 10 µF = \( 10 \times 10^{-6} \, F \)
- Potential Difference (\( V \)) = 100 V

Now we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} \, F) \times (100 \, V)^2 \]

First, calculate \( V^2 \):

\[ V^2 = (100 \, V)^2 = 10000 \, V^2 \]

Now substitute this back into the equation:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-2} \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.1 \, J \]
\[ U = 0.05 \, J \]

Therefore, the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V is:

"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

Let's start by solving the inequality for the expression under the square root:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

First, factorize the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) \]

So, we need to solve:

\[ (x-4)(x+1) > 0 \]

To find where this inequality holds true, consider the critical points \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -1 \). These are the roots of the equation \( (x-4)(x+1) = 0 \).

We can test intervals around these critical points to determine where the product is positive:

- For \( x < -1 \), both factors \( (x-4) \) and \( (x+1) \) are negative, so their product is positive.
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \), one factor is negative and the other is positive, so their product is negative.
- For \( x > 4 \), both factors are positive, so their product is positive.

Thus, the inequality \( (x-4)(x+1) > 0 \) holds for:

\[ x < -1 \quad \text{or} \quad x > 4 \]

Therefore, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is all real numbers except those in the interval \([-1, 4]\).

In set notation, this can be written as:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

1. Calculate \(2^3 = 8\)
2. Calculate \(3^3 = 27\)
3. Calculate \(5^2 = 25\)

Then multiply these together:
\[ 8 \times 27 = 216 \]
\[ 216 \times 25 = 5400 \]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.
