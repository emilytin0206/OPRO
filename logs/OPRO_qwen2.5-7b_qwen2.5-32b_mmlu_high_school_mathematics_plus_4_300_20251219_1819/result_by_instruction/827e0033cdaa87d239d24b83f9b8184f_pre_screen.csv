"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's break down each option and apply relevant principles from electrostatics.

### Context Analysis:
- **Nonconducting Sphere**: Initially given a net positive charge \(+Q\).
- **Neutral Conducting Sphere**: Initially has no net electric charge (neutral).

When the nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge is brought close to the neutral conducting sphere, several phenomena can occur due to electrostatic induction.

### Option Analysis:

**A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**
- **Explanation**: When a charged object approaches a conductor, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. The side of the conductor closest to the charge will develop an opposite charge (negative), and the far side will develop a positive charge. This is due to the movement of free electrons in the conductor.
- **Conclusion**: True. An electric field from the nonconducting sphere will induce charges on the conducting sphere.

**B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.**
- **Explanation**: A neutral conductor cannot have a net charge; it can only redistribute its charges to create an induced effect.
- **Conclusion**: False. The conducting sphere will not acquire a net charge of \(-Q\). Instead, it will develop induced charges that balance out the external field.

**C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**
- **Explanation**: A positive charge on one object and an induced negative charge on the closest part of the other conductor will result in an attractive force between them.
- **Conclusion**: True. There will be an electrostatic attraction due to opposite charges.

**D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**
- **Explanation**: Since one sphere is positively charged and the other has induced negative charges, there should be a net attractive force rather than repulsive.
- **Conclusion**: False. Repulsion would occur if both objects had like charges (both positive or both negative), which is not the case here.

### Final Answer:
The most accurate answer based on the provided information is:

**(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**",1.0,"Analyze the context of the question in depth, apply relevant theories or calculations if necessary, critically evaluate each option, and select the most accurate answer based on the provided information.",11
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To determine the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[ E = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( E \) is the energy (or work done),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance, \( C = 10 \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} F \)
- Potential difference, \( V = 100 V \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ E = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6} F) \times (100 V)^2 \]

First, calculate \( V^2 \):

\[ V^2 = (100 V)^2 = 10000 V^2 \]

Now substitute this back into the equation:

\[ E = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ E = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ E = 5 \times 10^{-3} J \]
\[ E = 0.005 J \]

Therefore, the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V is:

(A) 0.005 J

"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the numerator and the denominator are defined. Specifically, for the square root in the denominator, the expression inside must be positive because the square root of a negative number is not real, and division by zero is undefined.

Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. **Identify where the denominator is defined:**
   The denominator is \(\sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 4}\). For the expression under the square root to be defined (and positive), we need:
   \[
   x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0
   \]

2. **Solve the inequality \(x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0\):**
   First, solve the equation \(x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0\) to find the critical points.
   \[
   x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x-4)(x+1) = 0
   \]
   So, the roots are:
   \[
   x = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -1
   \]

3. **Determine the intervals where \(x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0\):**
   The critical points divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -1)\), \((-1, 4)\), and \((4, \infty)\). We test a point in each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

   - For \(x \in (-\infty, -1)\), choose \(x = -2\):
     \[
     (-2)^2 - 3(-2) - 4 = 4 + 6 - 4 = 6 > 0
     \]
   - For \(x \in (-1, 4)\), choose \(x = 0\):
     \[
     0^2 - 3(0) - 4 = -4 < 0
     \]
   - For \(x \in (4, \infty)\), choose \(x = 5\):
     \[
     5^2 - 3(5) - 4 = 25 - 15 - 4 = 6 > 0
     \]

   Therefore, the inequality \(x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0\) holds in the intervals:
   \[
   (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty)
   \]

4. **Combine with the domain restrictions:**
   The function is defined where the denominator is positive and non-zero. Since we have already determined that \(x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0\) in the intervals \((-\infty, -1)\) and \((4, \infty)\), these are the valid domains for the function.

Thus, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \) is:
\[
(-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty)
\]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider several legal principles, particularly those related to declaratory judgment actions and the standards for obtaining such relief. The Supreme Court has established that federal courts can issue declaratory judgments when there is an actual controversy between parties with opposing interests. However, the court must also balance its role in judicial review against potential interference with state prosecutions.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
- This option suggests that the federal district court should dismiss the action because it might interfere with ongoing state proceedings. However, this reasoning is not necessarily applicable in all cases where a declaratory judgment is sought. The Supreme Court has recognized that declaratory judgments can be issued even when there are existing prosecutions if they serve to clarify legal rights and obligations.

(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
- This option is incorrect as it does not consider the specific circumstances of this case. The law student's companions were arrested for criminal trespass and loitering, which suggests that there is indeed a threat of enforcement against him.

(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
- This option correctly identifies that the law student has shown a genuine threat of enforcement. The Supreme Court's decision in *Warth v. Seldin* (1975) established that a plaintiff must have standing to bring a declaratory judgment action, which includes showing an actual or imminent injury. The arrest of his companions and prior warnings provide sufficient evidence of this threat.

(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.
- This option is incorrect as it suggests that the law student’s fears are too speculative to justify seeking declaratory relief. The Supreme Court has recognized that declaratory judgments can address potential future harms if they are sufficiently imminent.

Given these considerations, the most accurate answer is:

(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.

This option correctly applies the legal standards for obtaining declaratory relief and acknowledges the actual or imminent injury that the law student faces.",0.0,"Analyze the context of the question in depth, apply relevant theories or calculations if necessary, critically evaluate each option, and select the most accurate answer based on the provided information.",11
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers without any remainder.

The orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

2. **Identify the Highest Powers of Each Prime**:
   - For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3\) (from 360).
   - For \(3\), the highest power is \(3^3\) (from 540).
   - For \(5\), the highest power is \(5^2\) (from 450).

3. **Calculate LCM**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2
   \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     - \(2^3 = 8\)
     - \(3^3 = 27\)
     - \(5^2 = 25\)

4. **Multiply the Results**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 8 \times 27 \times 25
   \]
   - First, multiply 8 and 27:
     \[
     8 \times 27 = 216
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by 25:
     \[
     216 \times 25 = 5400
     \]

Thus, the least common multiple of 360, 450, and 540 is 5400.

### Conclusion:

The minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 5400.",1.0,"Analyze the context of the question in depth, apply relevant theories or calculations if necessary, critically evaluate each option, and select the most accurate answer based on the provided information.",11
