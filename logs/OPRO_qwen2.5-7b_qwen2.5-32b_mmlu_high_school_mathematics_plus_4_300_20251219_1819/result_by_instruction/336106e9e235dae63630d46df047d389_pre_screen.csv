"What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?
(A) (-4,4)
(B) [0,4]
(C) (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)
(D) (-inf, -1) U (-1, 4) U (4, inf)",C,"To determine the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \), we need to ensure that both the denominator and the expression under the square root are valid. Specifically:

1. The expression inside the square root, \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \), must be greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.
2. The denominator cannot be zero.

First, let's solve for when the expression under the square root is greater than zero:

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \]

We start by finding the roots of the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0 \):

\[ x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \]

So, the roots are:

\[ x = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -1 \]

Next, we analyze the sign of \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \) in the intervals determined by these roots: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 4) \), and \( (4, \infty) \).

- For \( x < -1 \): Choose a test point, say \( x = -2 \):
  \[ (-2)^2 - 3(-2) - 4 = 4 + 6 - 4 = 6 > 0 \]
  
- For \( -1 < x < 4 \): Choose a test point, say \( x = 0 \):
  \[ (0)^2 - 3(0) - 4 = -4 < 0 \]

- For \( x > 4 \): Choose a test point, say \( x = 5 \):
  \[ (5)^2 - 3(5) - 4 = 25 - 15 - 4 = 6 > 0 \]

Thus, the expression \( x^2 - 3x - 4 \) is greater than zero in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1) \) and \( (4, \infty) \).

Since the denominator cannot be zero, we exclude the points where the expression equals zero, which are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 4 \). Therefore, the domain of the function is:

\[ (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty) \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

"A nonconducting sphere is given a nonzero net electric charge, +Q, and then brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. Which of the following will be true?
(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.
(B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q.
(C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.
(D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.",C,"To analyze this problem, let's consider the principles involved:

1. **Induced Electric Field in Conductors**: When a nonconducting sphere with a net positive charge +Q is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, the charges within the conducting sphere will rearrange themselves due to the influence of the external electric field created by the nonconducting sphere.

2. **Charge Redistribution in Conductors**: In a conductor, free electrons can move freely and will be influenced by an external electric field. The presence of the positively charged nonconducting sphere will cause these free electrons to move away from the side facing the nonconducting sphere, leaving that region with a net positive charge. Conversely, on the opposite side of the conducting sphere, there will be a net negative charge.

3. **Electrostatic Forces**: Electrostatic forces between charges can either attract or repel depending on their signs. A positively charged object will attract negatively charged objects and repel other positively charged objects.

Given these principles:

- (A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere: This is true because the presence of a nonconducting sphere with +Q charge will induce an electric field in the conducting sphere, causing charges to rearrange.
  
- (B) The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of –Q: This statement is incorrect. While there will be regions of negative and positive charge on the conducting sphere due to induced charges, the overall net charge of the conductor remains zero because it was initially neutral.

- (C) The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction: This could be true if one sphere has a positive charge and the other has a negative charge. However, since the nonconducting sphere is positively charged (+Q), the induced charges in the conducting sphere will create regions of opposite signs on its surface, leading to both attractive and repulsive forces.

- (D) The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion: This statement is not necessarily true for all parts of the spheres. While there might be some repulsion due to like charges on certain areas, overall, the interaction could result in a net attraction because opposite charges are closer together than like charges.

Considering these points, the most precise answer based on the principles of electrostatics and charge distribution is:

(A) An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement carefully, apply relevant concepts or calculations as necessary, eliminate incorrect options based on provided information, and select the most precise answer from those available.",7
"How much work is required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?
(A) 0.005 J
(B) 0.01 J
(C) 0.05 J
(D) 0.1 J",C,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

where:
- \( U \) is the energy (or work required),
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference.

Given:
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 10 µF = \(10 \times 10^{-6}\) F
- Potential Difference (\(V\)) = 100 V

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2 \]

First, calculate \(100^2\):

\[ 100^2 = 10000 \]

Then multiply by the capacitance:

\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10000 \]
\[ U = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} \]
\[ U = 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ J} \]

So, the work required to charge the capacitor is:

\[ U = 0.005 \text{ J} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 0.005 J.",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement carefully, apply relevant concepts or calculations as necessary, eliminate incorrect options based on provided information, and select the most precise answer from those available.",7
"A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?
(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.",C,"To answer this question accurately, we need to consider the principles surrounding declaratory judgment actions, particularly in light of Supreme Court precedents and the specific circumstances presented.

The key points from the scenario include:
- The law student and friends were peacefully handing out fliers at a mall.
- They received warnings from police but continued their activities.
- Their companions were arrested for criminal trespass and loitering.
- The law student filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes.

The Supreme Court has established that declaratory judgments can be granted when there is a ""real and immediate"" threat of enforcement against the plaintiff. This means that the plaintiff must show more than just a hypothetical or speculative fear; they need to demonstrate a genuine, imminent risk of prosecution.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
- This is incorrect because the law student has not been prosecuted yet. The arrest of his companions does not directly affect him unless he can show a genuine threat to himself.

(B) No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
- While this statement is generally true, it doesn't fully address the ""real and immediate"" threat requirement. The law student must still demonstrate that there's an imminent risk of enforcement against him.

(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
- This option is correct. The law student has shown that he was warned and his friends were arrested, which indicates a real and immediate threat to him if he continues his activities.

(D) Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.
- This is incorrect because the law student can demonstrate a genuine threat based on the prior warnings and arrests of his companions. The fear is not purely speculative but grounded in real events.

Therefore, the most precise answer is:

(C) No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement carefully, apply relevant concepts or calculations as necessary, eliminate incorrect options based on provided information, and select the most precise answer from those available.",7
"Planets X, Y and Z take 360, 450 and 540 days, respectively, to rotate around the same sun. If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?
(A) 360
(B) 5400
(C) 900
(D) 1200",B,"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the orbital periods of planets X, Y, and Z. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the numbers without any remainder.

The given orbital periods are:
- Planet X: 360 days
- Planet Y: 450 days
- Planet Z: 540 days

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
   - \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
   - \(540 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

Next, we determine the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \(2^3\) (from 360).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^3\) (from 540).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\) (from 450).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \]

Now we calculate this product:

\[
2^3 = 8
\]
\[
3^3 = 27
\]
\[
5^2 = 25
\]

Multiplying these together:
\[
8 \times 27 = 216
\]
\[
216 \times 25 = 5400
\]

Therefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is \(5400\) days.
